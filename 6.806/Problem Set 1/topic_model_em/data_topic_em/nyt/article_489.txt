the electricity business was starting get sort sexy deregulation brought new ideas and styles new york starting the late 1990s blow dried hipster capitalists were starchy government regulators were out frontier mentality epitomized companies like enron the giant houston based energy trader blew into new york bearing all the trappings marlboro country wildcatters roughnecks and bright eyed dreamers staked their claims pass the word the starch back town government which was least theory supposed exiting stage right deregulation proceeded instead assuming many ways more central role than ever how energy new york and other states well notably california made distributed and sold the even keel for electricity supply that has been predicted for new york city this summer made possible not much the rough and tumble open market the state bureaucrats the new york power authority which built house size power plants around the city last year providing extra megawatts power which expected crucial july and august the same time state conservation and efficiency programs put together last year promise reduce electricity use during peak periods like hot summer days energy experts say giving new york important breathing room this year address its long term energy needs but the frontier mentality also the run for reasons that deeper than mere megawatts the terrorist attack september state officials said reinforced the connection between energy dependability and energy security which they say must the government province protecting the system through measures like diversification fuel supplies has become major element the state energy plan being completed this spring the same time the collapse enron which was considered the leading voice for reducing government regulation minimum has made fusty bureaucrats look good comparison california both its energy meltdown last year and its subsequent response with things like energy efficiency construction standards has further inspired those who think that more should rendered unto the public sphere and less the market the enron mantra that government can screw anything touches and markets are superior this argument longer has any credibility whatsoever said william hogan professor public policy and administration harvard kennedy school government who leading authority electricity regulation you stand after enron and and say something like that people look you like you crazy few experts suggest that the pendulum has shifted far that states like new york will reverse course altogether and return the old fully regulated monopoly days even they could most power plants that were owned utilities have been sold other owners for one thing but experts from fields varied environmentalism and economics say the momentum clearly toward government one industry official put with thumb the scale story can end here optional material follows historians say that the deregulatory tilt also had very broad social and economic forces behind many people probably now associate the beginnings deregulation the 1970s with the conservative get government off our backs mentality that propelled people like ronald reagan into office governor california and later president but crucial support also came from the political left said richard abrams professor history the university california berkeley who studies government business relations although business was irked pollution and affirmative action laws passed the late 1960s and early 1970s abrams said there was also groundswell opinion against big monopolies fueled the leftover social impulses the 1960s bell became object ridicule and was later broken ralph nader argued that regulation tended reinforce the status quo rewarding companies that were already connected now some energy industry officials say they fear things could tip too far the other way the rush regulation scares said william brier vice president for communication the edison electric institute trade group said that the industry task moment when people are anxious and things seem have broken down keep things perspective the enron scandal said about financial markets and accounting not about energy and electricity doesn have anything with said for the new government interventionists there also fine line walked the chairman the new york state energy planning board william flynn said that the terrorist attack last fall forced shift thinking about energy security the people formulating the state new energy plan which will released late spring early summer but flynn who also president the new york state energy research and development authority which administers million year fund for conservation and efficiency programs said his marketing efforts have drawn the line linking things like energy self sufficiency conservation programs directly public concerns about terrorist disruptions makes talking about these issues much more serious said but don have overt emphasis security the programs speak for themselves some electrical system administrators say that the current period quiet the electricity market new york with lower prices lower demand and adequate supplies forecast through the summer also heightens and complicates government responsibility keep residents and business leaders focused long term needs many power plants that were proposed for new york are now unlikely built because tightening the financial markets result the enron debacle and many ratepayers might not think about electricity when the lights stay and the bills don but that when falls government stand the mountain top and take the long view said steve sullivan spokesman for the new york state independent system operator which runs the state power grid new york state will need megawatts new power supply over the next five years said but the money and the will must committed now other experts say that government gets too much credit jerry taylor the director natural resource studies the cato institute research group washington that favors limited government and free markets argues that most state conservation and efficiency programs not really work all the real reason that demand was shaved off the peaks new york last year and the summer before which was far hotter was the rate structure taylor said the system allowed higher prices passed onto consumers that meant that when supplies got tight prices rose sending powerful economic signal customers especially big businesses that had the most lose cut back energy use california contrast price caps electricity kept cheap even during last year crisis which gave people and businesses little economic incentive conserve compounding the crisis taylor said new york the rate structure for utilities sends signals that many environmentalists say are also completely contradictory the state official goals because utilities like consolidated edison which serves new york city and its northern suburbs make their profits moving much energy through their wires they can they have interest best have conflicted interest having their customers using less electricity through steps like conservation under the old regulated system contrast utilities were rewarded for reducing demand now the state discourages conservation with one hand and encourages with the other the critics say the result might look like smart government but depends your point view still don have good long term strategy even medium term strategy said ashok gupta senior energy economist the natural resources defense council new york based conservation group have ideology followed crisis management but strategy
