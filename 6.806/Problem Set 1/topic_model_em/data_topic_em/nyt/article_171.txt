with the whole cosmos its agenda the meeting the american astronomical society last week washington was sounding board for scientists with new findings and ideas about nearly everything from mysterious gamma ray bursts deep space revealing images penetrating the turbulent heart the milky way earth home galaxy two new discoveries described the meeting underscored the growing and bewildering realization that planetary systems abound the nearby universe and that they come all shapes and sizes bearing little apparent resemblance the sun family planets both discoveries revealed unexpected configurations stars and orbiting companions observations telescopes hawaii astronomers were surprised detect object that ordinary planet orbiting sunlike star light years from earth the object brown dwarf the name given what are thought failed stars that lacked the mass ignite their nuclear furnaces michael liu astronomer the university hawaii reported that the brown dwarf was estimated have mass about times great that jupiter the solar system largest planet the brown dwarf orbiting the star called sge distance billion miles times the distance between earth and the sun and more than twice close any previously detected stellar companion that more massive than ordinary planets the more than giant objects that have recently been found orbiting nearby stars most have been estimated jupiter size planets but several are massive that they are suspected having starlike origins and thus being brown dwarfs this companion probably too massive have formed the way believe that planets namely from circumstellar disk gas and dust when the star was young liu said this finding suggests that diversity processes act populate the outer regions other solar systems other astronomers said the brown dwarf discovery was important because was the first these extrasolar companion objects detected direct observations not indirectly measuring the effects their gravity the motions the host stars new technology called adaptive optics spinoff military research uses computers compensate for atmospheric distortions and produce sharper images faint cosmic objects alan boss astrophysicist the carnegie institution washington and theorist who specializes the new planetary systems said such discoveries were really just tantalizing appetizers for things come report related discovery astronomers said they had detected for the first time planet orbiting extremely large star one that had already burned its hydrogen fuel and was dying the star iota draconis has expanded radius that times great that the sun which average size star until now was not known planets existed around such giant stars said sabine frink the university california san diego member the discovery team this provides the first evidence that planets earth like distances can survive the evolution their host star into giant sometimes coming down earth astronomers speak almost ordinary language when they talked the meeting about cosmic bubbles fountains and halos the bubbles are this case ghostly cavities huge galactic clusters the clusters more galaxies stretch millions light years across and are considered the largest stable objects the universe from the centers the clusters cavities virtually devoid ray and radio emissions rise like bubbles glass soda pop some bubbles are large light years wide almost big the milky way brian mcnamara astronomer ohio university athens described the discovery and analysis the bubbles with data from the chandra ray observatory earth orbit the bubbles mcnamara said were most likely created extremely powerful explosions probably involving material plunging toward grasping black holes observations show that the bubbles are not completely empty but contain some hot gas high energy particles and magnetic fields the bubbles may play major role transporting magnetic fields through the clusters think magnetism some locations the universe could have been important gravity shaping the galaxies and even larger scale cosmic structures ncnamara said edward murphy astronomer the university virginia reported other spacecraft observations that have yielded evidence for towering fountain gas nearby galaxy ngc which telescopes bears resemblance whale the spacecraft the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer fuse operated for nasa the johns hopkins university describing the phenomenon news conference murphy managed use all three evocative terms bubbles and halos well fountains did that proposing possible solution the longstanding mystery the ultimate fate energy from exploding stars supernovas profusion stellar explosions murphy suggested would probably start the circulation hot gas rising fountain bubbles out the galaxy and into the halo diffuse cooler gas that surrounds the galaxy gas remaining the halo for perhaps million years would presumably cool and fall back into the galaxy bringing with material for the next generation new stars murphy said the fuse data provided the first good evidence for the long theorized galactic fountain cycle circulating gas some the same ultraviolet observations have enabled astronomers detect clouds hydrogen gas raining onto the milky way galaxy and glowing contact with the intergalactic medium like showers meteors that streak through earth upper atmosphere from the fuse data the astronomers found that beyond the previously known and denser halo around the milky way there was another one less dense and hot possibly one million degrees fahrenheit that outer halo invisible ordinary light can see ultraviolet light blue football shape envelope around the entire galaxy astronomers said the outer halo could left over from the formation the milky way may have been created early episodes star formation which the hot gas was heaved supernovas and expelled from the galactic disk perhaps some kind fountain bubbles any event because astronomers are still detecting the hydrogen clouds that are falling into the galaxy they think the milky way still pulling new material the new findings said kenneth sembach the space telescope science institute baltimore are going help astronomers understand better how galaxies are assembled and hopefully how they evolved over time entertainment and culture stories from the new york times news service for tuesday jan verdi
