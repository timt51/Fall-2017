fires are burning thousands underground coal seams from pennsylvania mongolia releasing toxic gases adding millions tons heat trapping carbon dioxide the atmosphere and baking the earth until vegetation shrivels and the land sinks scientists and government agencies are starting use heat sensing satellites map the fires and try new ways extinguish them but many instances particularly asia they are widespread and stubborn that miners simply work around the flames there geological evidence that grassland and forest fires lightning and spontaneous combustion coal have spawned such fires for hundreds thousands years wyoming and northern china broad layers earth are composed clinker the brittle baked rock left behind when subterranean coal burns but the frequency coal fires appears have risen experts say mining has exposed more and more deposits around the world fires both natural and set people and the oxygen that feeds them increasingly scientists are saying the problem needs more carefully assessed both potential contributor global warming and source toxic air pollution report the clean coal center the international energy agency concluded that the biggest coal fires china and india particularly make significant global impact these fires are obviously pumping all this noxious material into the air said glenn stracher geologist and expert mine fires east georgia college swainsboro that got having some effects but one has been studying the coal fires are similar those that have smoldered for three months beneath the wreckage the world trade center that they involve buried fuels and are sustained and intensified slight drafts air and heat locked into surrounding rubble rock geologists and engineers who have studied coal fires offered their expertise and specialized equipment like firefighting foams emergency officials lower manhattan but firefighters the scene stuck mainly with the simplest method pouring endless streams water the wreckage work crews slowly removed layers debris many coal fires start spontaneously when pyrite and other reactive minerals coal are exposed oxygen they begin release heat which not dissipated air currents builds until the coal itself ignites indonesia hundreds coal fires erupted deep the rain forests when forest fires spread during extreme drought and scorched exposed coal seams alfred whitehouse fire expert for the federal office surface mining now assigned indonesia said there were such fires just east kalimantan the island borneo some were extinguished crews using hand pumps and picks isolate the hot spots but many are still burning said the fires persist long there the right mix fuel oxygen and heat sometimes that can very long time one fire eating deep into australian peak called burning mountain believed have been going strong for years the mountain has often been mistaken for simmering volcano passers although australia has volcanic activity the united states common cause such fires has been the burning trash dumped into abandoned mines that how the coal fire most familiar many americans started years ago centralia town the anthracite region eastern pennsylvania smoldering trash dump ignited coal seam the fire steadily crept through abandoned mine tunnels forcing the federal government evict residents and eventually pay million buy damaged land centralia briefly gained national notoriety then faded away its population shrank from smoke and steam now rise from overgrown back yards and cracked sunken streets marking the path subterranean fires that continue consume buried coal geologists say could burn for another hundred years but centralia just one dozens fires that smolder unchecked old mines and coal seams around the country the federal office surface mining has tallied nearly billion accumulated costs from coal fires primarily pennsylvania west virginia utah colorado kentucky and wyoming and the coal fires the united states are negligible compared with those overseas china rich northern coal belt hundreds underground fires are burning upward million tons coal each year about percent the nation annual production the fires produce nearly much carbon dioxide the main gas linked global warming emitted each year all the cars and small trucks the united states only the last few years have scientists begun concerted effort map and monitor coal fires around the world and calculate how much pollution they are producing for the moment the total anyone guess said anupma prakash geological mapping expert the international institute for aerospace survey and earth sciences the netherlands prakash has been developing ways integrate maps the heat the earth surface generated satellites with geological maps track coal fires northern china often deep coal fire raises the surface temperatures only few degrees even though the heat the middle the fire can easily exceed degrees but that subtle signal enough show from space particularly when other clues about coal deposits are combined with the heat data prakash said the team from her institute together with chinese geologists recently generated map china coal fires that showed constellation glowing orange spots spread across the country northern coal belt which spans miles and miles wide one goal prakash said monitor the region continually from space spots that are growing warmer indicating intensifying fires can attacked firefighters before the fires grow the point where they cannot not stopped the important thing detect the rising heat anomalies ahead time she said once they get going these buried fires are very hard stop said stanley michalski senior staff geologist gai consultants firm monroeville that for more than years has studied fires and designed firefighting plans from india centralia the coal beds pennsylvania michalski said tend generate particularly persistent fires because the corrugated terrain there has many separate narrow coal seams that reach the surface and the ground heavily fractured allowing ample oxygen reach the coal many parts the state like the foundation centralia are also riddled with old abandoned tunnels that carry air into the coal layers and expose broad surfaces coal heat for many years engineers and scientists have been experimenting with variety ways extinguish control the fires some small fires have been snuffed drilling holes and pumping inert gases foams that stifle flames others have been flooded damming surface streams and creating lakes over the burning coal some fires have been controlled excavating deep trenches that cut off the fires the same way fire break woodland can stop forest fire from spreading but most cases the costs such efforts outweigh the benefits that was why centralia picked and moved and why another pennsylvania community youngstown may suffer the same fate overseas however some the fires are densely populated regions where hundreds thousands poor people live the edges open pits that fume and flame many such places the mining industry has simply adapted the situation working and around the burning rock parts one india most important coal fields the jharia mining complex which rich low sulfur coal used produce coke for steel mills have been fire since many places the walls open pit mines glow and hiss like lava flows story can end here optional material follows the region miners truck drivers train loaders and other workers toil stolidly against constant backdrop orange flames and brown smoke but the fires are far more than inconvenience sept the walls one mine complex collapsed after being progressively weakened fires water from nearby canal poured and flooded the pits and tunnels killing more than miners the population around the jharia mines has grown from half million million since the early 1980s said prakash whose doctoral thesis was analysis the fires there michalski has also surveyed the jharia fires several times since the early 1990s when the world bank hired his company assess what plan was drawn modify the mining operations and constrain the fires but the bank never released the money michalski said conceded that would take awful lot money loss valuable resource environmental disaster devastating michalski said but this fire complicated and widespread that india could not really afford extinguish the meantime the fires there still burn and residents and mineworkers continue adapt places where the ground cracks and slumps and smokes people simply dismantle their mud brick homes and move them somewhere else
