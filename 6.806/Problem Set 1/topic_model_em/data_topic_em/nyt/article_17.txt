fans who have been hoping for rivalry emerge the pga tour may close getting serious villain shining knight depending your opinion crusade against tiger woods the golf season begins today along the rugged windswept paradise maui phil mickelson absence the mercedes championships has made his status the world ranked player all the more conspicuous has spoken openly about his desire higher those rankings and according one woods closest friends the fact mickelson and woods are not pals should fuel their budding rivalry think have rivalry now with tiger and phil butch harmon woods coach said part that they are not the best friends for whatever reason not like ugly thing they just aren buddies this how rivalries sometimes are born doesn require bitter hatred just basic difference attitude personality look back the best golf rivalry ever jack nicklaus arnold palmer and you find they were never buddy buddy early their careers they were respectful each other but they were never dinner companions until their senior years does mickelson woods have chance according harmon already begun because they are and the world that always going create some sort rivalry between the two guys said what compounds that they are two entirely different personalities with two really different philosophies life there animosity they just don get along that well the rest the guys david duval ernie els and all the rest all get along pretty well there real rivalry there maybe this what the pga tour needs some good old fashioned bad blood stoke the competitive fires would help course mickelson would ever win major even show play since hasn competed pga tour event since the nec invitational august missing the mercedes limited field event for winners tournaments spend time with his family assuming returns later this month mickelson will have waiting for him rejuvenated woods and flock new young players who think they are ready take woods mickelson els and duval woods coming off five win which the only player couldn measure was himself and his wins the two previous seasons says eager get under way after satisfying short offseason think two weeks qualifies enough offseason said adding that actually fresher now than was last year when the season began really excited about playing was fired when got here and even more fired now good feeling know that starting over again from scratch last year this time was worn out because had come off playing eight row this year been able have some breaks get some time off even though only had two weeks off felt longer than that asked what his goals are for woods said same thing want every year win every tournament play becoming obvious that woods and seasons are going rank among the best golf history may never again measure the level that saw him win half the time played but the ongoing debate about whether the gap has closed between woods and the pack sure continue this year think that question you asking said sergio garcia added duval think going into last year all knew would very difficult what did again win half the events that you play during year along with three majors that tough thing going into last year didn think win nine times again and didn just stunk winning only five times with major that woods norm then the rest the tour big trouble even the younger players who are perhaps too young know they should intimidated woods the young stallions who figure force the tour this year are led charles howell iii who earned rookie the year honors last season even though didn have any playing privileges the start the year but not kapalua this week and david gossett the former texas longhorn the winners only field because won the john deere classic last year while playing sponsor exemption gossett thrilled about being the only young gun aside from garcia this week field nice not have worry about any those guys this week because they aren here gossett said but true that the tour getting younger and younger competing with the best players the world and holding our own there one theory tour that the young guns are getting too much credit too soon the first thing worry about getting privileges duval said you have get your playing privileges before you can worry about doing anything else appreciate their attitude but you have take the right steps course howell gossett and others are trying skip few those steps the top and year old tryon the tour will have its youngest player ever this year garcia perhaps the only member the kiddie corps who has legitimate claim included with woods mickelson and garcia two wins could signify ready start tracking down woods already has big designs has said would like lead both the tour and the european tour money earnings didn say going said said like garcia probably the most sincere all the pros when talking about woods knows that where the standard rests when think have chance good that age hopefully better said garcia who turns next week right now just more exciting play when the tournament when tournament gives little extra spicy taste you want beat him beaten him head head last year buick classic almost beat him the pga consider myself challenger him does mickelson but will have wait until later this month either phoenix pebble beach confront woods for the first time woods said surprised mickelson isn the season opening tournament but heard lot different things about what going with his family woods said whatever sure good reason mickelson coming off year when had top finishes compared only nine for woods but that statistical note doesn mean much some think good players guys who are the hall fame don sit around talking about how many top finishes they had harmon said all about winning for them and that how should this game mickelson achievements however coincided with season ending stretch for woods which was out the top eight his last nine tournaments was that late season lull that helped mickelson cause when said the gap had been closed woods phil could have had incredible year last year harmon said was position win six seven eight times really good position and that great accomplishment still you have assume that having been that position and have only won couple times that has frustrating only knows that for sure builds that season however could have another great year and they say the game would between mickelson and woods
