maria rupnick turns out right losing weight may one day become unprecedentedly easy for millions obese people laboratory experiments mit and the children hospital boston rupnick has shown that entire class compounds designed inhibit cancer may also without any obvious side effects cause extraordinary weight loss far rupnick now researcher and instructor brigham amp women hospital boston and harvard medical school has conducted her experiments only mice especially called mice which are very fat creatures naturally predisposed eating constantly and thus weighing two three times much normal mouse could long time before her theory tested humans indeed rupnick has not yet even published her findings which she submitted november scientific journal where they are currently under peer review already though rupnick who has received young investigators award from the american heart association for her work and october she received patent which covers the commercial applications her work among rupnick mentors are two maverick investigators judah folkman and robert langer postdoctoral student she worked the laboratory folkman the surgeon and cancer researcher harvard who for decades bucked conventional medical wisdom theorizing that tumors were able grow beyond certain size because they could create their own blood vessels folkman was the first create angiogenesis inhibitor drug designed shrink tumors cutting off their blood supply more than score angiogenesis inhibitors are currently clinical trials and these drugs now are considered among the most promising cancer research about three years ago rupnick started wonder whether the inhibitors might also have effect fat but when she reviewed scientific literature the subject she did not find much but for rupnick fat was fascinating adult whether human mammal have all the blood vessels need she said unless there injury pregnancy new blood vessels are created the highway already built except the case fat adipose tissue fat noncancerous normal tissue that unlike any other tissue the body can grow and regress grow and regress rapidly and substantially depending caloric intake rupnick said rupnick remembers folkman was not initially enthusiastic about her proposal study the vascular structure fat nor was anyone else the conservative response she recalled was what are you crazy you never able get funding one will ever publish your work there are just many charlatan things associated with the market the climate the time was certainly not propitious fen phen popular diet drug combination had recently been pulled from the market because was suspected causing heart valve damage moreover folkman was involved controversy after outside scientists initially were unable replicate his success treating mice tumors attacking the tumors blood supply understandably had concerns about the publicity that her research might generate rupnick said early scientists the national cancer institute said they were able confirm folkman results despite the reservations her colleagues harvard rupnick said langer investigator mit who specializes tissue engineering was intrigued her fat investigations bob langer comes from mit which has very different perspective she said translates and deals with business much more than the medical school does rupnick tested five different angiogenesis inhibitors including tnp angiostatin and endostatin mice and other obese mice the most surprising thing was that not only did the mice stop gaining weight they also lost significant amount weight depending the dose decreased their body weight almost half that enormous rupnick said the drugs were working far better than any approved obesity drug ever had she said the first reaction she got from obesity experts was that the drugs must toxic but rupnick said that normal dosages far she had found evidence toxicity the mice and while the fat tissue shrinks nothing else appears not the brain the heart the liver any other organ nor did the mice seem developing diabetes any other chronic disease why did they lose much weight rupnick theory that the mice whose appetites decreased significantly while the drugs were using the fat fuel that fat goes into their blood stream which where has because has somewhere gets converted into fatty acids and other things that can used fuel she said the animal essentially consumes its own fat for energy don think that toxic all said rupnick who noted nonetheless that would impossible prove that any drug was percent nontoxic angiogenesis inhibitors however can interfere with wound healing and menstruation pregnancy rupnick work suggests that blood vessels fat never seem fully mature but they instead exist special environment that allows them grow retract depending upon the caloric needs the organism this could have much larger implications rupnick who trained cardiologist imagines that one day perhaps blood vessels organs like the heart might coaxed back into their immature state and made heal themselves the meantime mit and the children hospital have licensed rupnick patent with langer and folkman listed inventors repair inc boston company attn sports editors
