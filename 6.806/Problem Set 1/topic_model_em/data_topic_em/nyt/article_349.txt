not many years ago the immense fires that blackened the dense forests the bitterroot mountains south here would have been labeled unmitigated disaster millions board feet timber down the drain many the trees that were salvageable would have been quickly logged but this land the environmentally savvy the management the publicly owned forests under microscope the biological toll that logging can take landscape well known toll that especially harsh forest hit hard high intensity fires its struggle cut and sell trees burned the enormous fires the summer the forest service finds itself trying convince environmentalists that careful logging not only benign but critical the forests recovery and protection the service which responsible for both forest health and selling timber has proposed salvaging million board feet ponderosa pine and other trees more than three times much would normally sold the area the service says the plan which involves more than blackened acres will create thousands jobs and raise money used help replant trees and repair stream beds environmentalists however are not buying the notion that the forest must logged save least not the scale the forest service proposes they challenged the sale procedural issue and early january federal judge agreed and stopped the project jan the forest service said would appeal and asked the judge allow five emergency sales ahead one the most controversial parts the recovery plan for the burned area may the potential for damage the soil forest service officials say any damage will minimized restrictions that allow logging only frozen and snow covered ground and using techniques like helicopter and skyline logging that keeps heavy equipment and dragged logs from disturbing soil but ken mcbride forest soils scientist with the forest service who has studied soil conditions the bitterroot national forest since argues that those protections don far enough and that the logging could cause lasting damage seen logging wrong too many times said mcbride who did not work the recovery plan for the service and opposing private citizen disturbance from logging compacts soil and scrapes away natural sources recovery said among them the seeds pine grass huckleberry and beargrass the organic layer gone and the soils lose their ability grow plants said natural recovery after fire especially such dry environment slow healing process said and add additional damage not smart thing logging can interfere with natural recovery other ways while some timber companies argue that leaving burned trees waste biologists say the trees play critical role the death the burned trees occurs progressively over year period says wayne minshall professor ecology idaho state university who has studied the effects fire western streams and landscapes for years they are like time release capsule begin optional trim while standing they provide cover for elk and deer when pine bark beetles and other insects swarm feed the dead trees woodpeckers and flickers follow and the charred trees provide home for these cavity nesters even burned trees help keep the forest floor cool hold soil place and reduce evaporation neither are fallen trees finished with their ecological responsibilities for they coddle life returns the forest once the logs come down there whole other suite species that use them said jack ward thomas the former chief the forest service and now professor wildlife conservation the university montana fallen trees act natural dams stop erosion steep slopes and can make nutrient rich soil they decay end optional trim dead trees also play important role stream ecosystems they stabilize soil and protect stream banks minshall said they provide shade and cover the streams keeping them cool enough help fish survive when warm nature says minshall takes care its own eventually streams are adapted physical disturbance like floods and fires said but added effects stream can devastating the first couple years ash burned trees and mud create charcoal slurry that once reaches stream can kill fish and scour out and widen streams factor times after this pulse burned material has been flushed out the ecosystem however the stream starts recover with the forest canopy gone places sunlight causes algae grow which feeds insects nutrients like nitrogen and potassium freed from vegetation the fire stimulate the growth willows and other riparian vegetation which improves insect populations and the size and number fish some logging minshall said could done where fires have occurred but under careful prescription preserve the time release effect you log you have keep the appropriate mix trees said and not just cut the trees that are biggest and most valuable forest service scientists not dispute the idea that burned trees play important role the recovery ecosystem but they argue that allowing nature reclaim itself this particular burned landscape could lead serious damage part because errant management policies the past more than century fire suppression has led unnaturally high levels fuel most forests even though trees were killed damaged the recent fire there remains potential for new kind threat they fall the ground when they burn they cause excessive heating soils effect sterilizing said mick harrington fire ecologist with the forest service fire research center missoula the forest here said evolved with frequent low intensity fires just pine needles the fire out four five minutes said you have logs the fires burns for hours and hours such hot fires impair the forest chance for natural recovery the life that lies waiting under the soil moreover leaving such high fuel loads the mountains above the valley some fire experts say could set the stage for disaster when the next big fire season hits forest fires get extremely hot they create severe weather said brown the fires spill out the mountains and are funneled through the canyons and into the low elevations high speed said something called the venturi effect fire propelled could impossible stop before hits the valley where many homes and towns are located the winds generated high intensity fires also create phenomena called vortex streets eddies that are like little tornadoes that carry embers many miles away from the fire start fires elsewhere story can end here optional material follows another forest service plan for the bitterroot preventive the service has planned thousands acres thinning removal fuels prevent new fires low lying areas which are densely populated they claim fire suppression has led many trees growing per acre rather than trees per acre when the fire regime more natural environmentalists say far too much timber being cut under the guise thinning contention backed recent research based study several wildfires including the cerro grande fire los alamos forest service research scientist jack cohen agrees that the agency overreaching with its thinning proposal what determines house burning the condition the house and its immediate surroundings cohen said there still tendency want thinning the wild land zone not possible and not necessary either
