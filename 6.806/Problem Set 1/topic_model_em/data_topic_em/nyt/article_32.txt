you know what they say about computers garbage garbage out you know what they say about nebraska how far the dumpster the bright side wasn the cornhuskers worst loss the past six weeks only their most recent and none the winnebagos the caravan from omaha and lincoln was known have overturned the long melancholy trip home which began before halftime much for redemption much for proving the merit the bowl championship series computer formula that gave nebraska second chance reality bytes was the miami hurricanes perfect storm this victory that finished unbeaten season and clinched the fifth national championship school history but for all its gale force was less than satisfying something was missing yes ballgame better check the fuses that computer the huskers the played like the end this might have been less validation for the bcs and more vexation actually taking the bloom off the rose bowl after all somebody else anybody else could have put better fight than the cornhuskers who turns out were just getting warmed losing their previous game would oregon similarly have been cooked into duck orange the hurricanes fire would colorado buffaloes have been just stampeded what about the texas longhorns the florida gators the rice owls for that matter who couldn have fallen behind five touchdowns halftime were obviously not top our game said nebraska coach frank solich can only hope all week long solich had defended the right his team take the grand stage the big game then the cornhuskers promptly forgot their lines stuttered into the footlights and got stage fright about the only things missing from nebraska clown act were fright wig rake step and bright red nose match the embarrassed faces the huskers fans who virtually filled the historic old stadium sure miami effort was impressive and overwhelming both sides the ball with defense that shut down the cornhuskers offense when mattered and with offense that was jet fueled the fighter planes that flew overhead during the national anthem nebraska quarterback eric crouch might have won the heisman trophy for season which there was clear cut favorite but cool clear night for showdown miami ken dorsey did whatever wanted dorsey completed passes for yards set miami bowl passing record and threw for three touchdowns two those scoring passes went split end andre johnson who caught seven balls for record yards and shared player the game honors with dorsey there was also running back clinton portis carrying times for yards and the difference mostly was miami team speed which allowed the hurricanes outrun the nebraska cornerbacks catch deep passes along the sidelines get behind the linebackers for catches over the middle break tackles and get the outside runs they are good balanced that don know what you stop them night when they playing this way solich said that much was obvious before halftime when johnson already had hauled passes from dorsey and eight yards when tight end kevin shockey had caught scoring pass yards when portis had sprinted yards for another and james lewis had returned interception pass crouch yards for lead his first johnson had virtually half the field himself catch the pass when nebraska corner keyuo craver fell and two defenders double teamed different receiver his run the end zone portis gave juke step his right that froze the nebraska defense cut left through hole broke tackle and ran from the grasp another cornhusker along the way even miami kicker todd sievers had pounced nebraska fumble what might well have been earthquake for the way the ground opened and practically swallowed the huskers word came from the nebraska sidelines the huskers did not have the proper football cleats keep them upright the damp turf yes must have been the shoes that caused many missed tackles and blown defensive covers must have been helmets that were too tight maybe happens the same way against oregon colorado florida any them maybe this was just miami night miami year still nebraska was hardly the proper yardstick was very unpleasant feeling solich said didn play well enough make competitive game the end even the end the first half hard argue with miami record but not the bcs computer garbage nebraska out
