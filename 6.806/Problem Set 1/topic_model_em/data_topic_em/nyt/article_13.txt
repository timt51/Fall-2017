less than year after california endured blackouts and political and economic upheaval when deregulated the power industry texas this week began its own deregulation plan with officials promising that there would reprise california chaos but consumer advocates while generally agreeing that the texas plan included better safeguards that california expressed skepticism that residential customers would benefit from long term price reductions energy providers compete for business these advocates also warned that texas like california had failed provide adequate protections ensure that the state does not suffer from electricity shortages demand increases for texas deregulation comes not long after enron corp the houston based energy giant that championed deregulated energy markets collapsed into bankruptcy meanwhile the chairman the state agency that will oversee the deregulated electricity market has come under political attack for his past ties enron the official launch deregulation texas was new year day but wednesday marked the first business day operation and yet few the million eligible households had chosen switch providers away from the long standing utilities state officials predicted that the transition would gradual particularly for residential customers many whom are still unaware that change afoot nor have electricity retailers rushed into the residential market yet new retailers have registered with the state but most are seeking commercial and industrial clients terry hadley spokesman for the texas public utility commission the agency overseeing the electricity marketplace said electricity retailers are sharpening their pencils see what kind offers they can make several companies are already marketing residential customers hadley predicted that such appeals will intensify coming months adding that officials hope see more companies come into the market will concerned see pullback from what starting out said still uncertain whether texas customers will embrace deregulation particularly after the problems california the new rules texas establish immediate retail price reduction between percent and percent drop partly attributable the low price natural gas which often used fuel electric generation plants this savings built into the price beat the state mandated price per kilowatt hour that the old utilities will allowed charge under deregulation keep their customers new retailers meanwhile will allowed offer lower prices way entice customers switch can compete with the existing price beat said marcie zlotnick spokeswoman for gexa energy new retailer that hopes sign residential customers the houston and dallas metropolitan areas years end she said her company would offer price cents per kilowatt hour versus the price beat cents another company green mountain energy austin which emphasizes wind generated power will actually charge small premium above the price beat texas officials have taken pains reassure consumers and journalists that california problems were unique california the state deregulated the wholesale power market while keeping retail prices capped this caused the state two biggest public utilities lose billions dollars when wholesale prices spiked and the retail price caps prevented them from pushing the costs along consumers one reason that wholesale prices jumped was that the price natural gas was then record high but california officials including gov gray davis also accused several energy companies including enron manipulating prices and exacerbating the state problems charge the companies denied california problems were also partly attributable lack supply the state had not built major power plant roughly decade endured rolling blackouts and other problems before federal regulators last summer ordered restraints electricity prices september the california public utilities commission voted shift away from deregulation since then states such nevada oklahoma and new mexico have postponed plans for deregulation but texas officials have expressed confidence their plan unlike california texas deregulated the wholesale electrical market providing time buffer work out any kinks before introducing retail deregulation this year and also unlike california texas has seen about power plants built the state during the past six years currently officials say the state electrical supply exceeds demand percent nor does the state plan mandate the sort retail price caps that crippled the california utilities have more than enough capacity and supply electricity hadley said and the mechanics are place make adjustments for any dramatic spike fuel costs and are going about this steady approach consumer advocates are more skeptical carol biedrzycki executive director the texas ratepayers organization save energy said the state should have required electricity providers maintain reserve margin electrical capacity roughly percent above demand she believes state officials have inflated power generating capacity and could face problems increasing demand few years order keep the prices stable have have reserve margin she said janee briesemeister senior analyst with the southwest regional office consumers union austin noted the primary selling point deregulation was that would bring lower energy prices consumers but she said group the new retailers have already sought increase the price beat effort that failed she said the relatively small number companies expressing interest the residential market could mean that state regulators may eventually have take some sort action fear that looks like there aren lot companies offering services consumers texas then their reaction will raise prices consumers she said story can end here optional material
