tools may arcane niche the computer industry but underscoring how crucial the campaign getting under way microsoft strategy for growth bill gates microsoft chairman and chief software architect scheduled speak thousands software developers san francisco and steve ballmer the chief executive scheduled speak thousands more chicago the outcome this campaign will partly determine the shape competition the software industry over the next several years its focus shifts called web services clever software that opens the door offering new level computerized automation and convenience companies and consumers microsoft and rivals including ibm and sun microsystems are scrambling supply businesses with these services which will allow computers share data across the internet and when programmed handle all kinds tasks without human intervention web service application for example might link company inventory database with that its suppliers automatically reordering parts when supplies run low car navigation computer increasingly common feature new automobiles can linked region traffic tracking database with web services application constantly updating traffic reports help driver find the least congested route corporations the promise web services both cost cutting automation and new offerings consumers and web services appear exception the overall slump technology spending this the year that lot investments are being made said david smith analyst gartner inc technology research and consulting firm which estimates that sales web services software will increase fivefold billion web services are the center microsoft plans said eric rudder senior vice president microsoft and the tools effort the key success failure the billion cost develop the new programming platform rudder said nothing compared the opportunity begin optional trim much microsoft success over the years can traced its understanding and catering rank and file developers the architects designers and bricklayers the information age who write the software that animates everything from the world financial markets fuel injectors trucks microsoft began the software tools business with microsoft basic its version the programming language created john kemeny and thomas kurtz dartmouth college this day gates speaks with pride his achievement squeezing microsoft basic into the tiny memory space available microcomputers the mid 1970s microsoft juggernaut product the windows operating system did not really take off until six years after its introduction when the company delivered visual basic tool that made far easier for developers write software applications that run windows microsoft hopes build that heritage its effort attract millions developers write web services applications with its tools microsoft first and foremost software company said rudder who heads the microsoft division that caters outside programmers company developers think like developers and love them yet rerun different heritage what concerns microsoft competitors and some antitrust regulators they see microsoft web services tools new computer language called sharp and integrated toolkit and programming platform called visual studio net part microsoft plan extend the reach and dominance its windows operating system end optional trim microsoft according analysts has built impressive array new tools that are both powerful and easy use the net platform allows developers work any existing programming languages including apl cobol perl smalltalk and even java the web programming language from sun microsystems which microsoft sharp intending supplant microsoft also employs alphabet soup industry standard protocols xml soap wsdl and uddi for describing identifying and communicating data over the web the company has cooperated with its rivals reach agreement these formats and others the world wide web consortium and other industry standards groups but while microsoft software can freely exchange data across the internet the web services applications built its net platform are made hosted only machines using microsoft windows contrast most its rivals ibm sun bea and others use industry standard version java j2ee the foundation their development platform web services built with the java based tools run all kinds hardware and operating systems not just windows for microsoft the internet still windows world said scott hebner director marketing for ibm websphere software group the more things change the more they stay the same the web services competition will not necessarily have antitrust implications most the rivalry will center software for big data serving computers which companies will host web services applications windows has strong and growing position server software but not dominant personal computer desktop operating systems the market that was the focus the federal antitrust case against the company but some competitors and some antitrust regulators worry that microsoft programming tools combined with its dominant positions desktop operating systems web browsing software and its passport online identification system threaten let microsoft gain unfair advantage web services story can end here optional material follows microsoft going operate web services network not just the software tools build applications said jonathan schwartz the chief strategy officer for sun its business model lock corporate customers and consumers the potential threat competition web services one reason that the nine states who oppose the government proposed settlement the antitrust case are holding out for tougher sanctions against microsoft court filing last friday the dissenting states declared microsoft thus potentially has the power create control and exploit the only effective and widely interoperable web services network microsoft lawyers and executives and the software wizard behind the programming tools scoff such claims wildly inaccurate and based flawed analogy with the industry web services will not winner take all market unlike the operating system market they say and besides microsoft has learned some lessons the last few years think you seeing different microsoft said anders hejlsberg who served chief architect the sharp language and helped guide work the other programming tools look the cooperative work done with world wide web consortium and other standards bodies doesn mean going stop competing hejlsberg added but going compete different way
