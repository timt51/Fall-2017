frederic mikulec postdoctoral chemistry student the university california san diego was scribing silicon chip with diamond cutter one day when something extraordinary happened exploded was like cap gun going off said michael sailor professor chemistry and biochemistry who runs the lab where mikulec works was pretty shocking because this material work with every day was like floppy disk suddenly blowing the time sailor lab was trying create new sensors for computer disk drives introducing magnetic materials into specially prepared silicon chips but since mikulec accident has turned its attention toward computer chips that flames security conscious age explosiveness might not seem the most desirable property for microchips but sailor said that exploding chips could used develop new types portable chemical analyzers for biowarfare provide source power light for extremely tiny machines allow computers containing highly sensitive commercial government data self destruct they fall into the wrong hands concept sailor explosive chips owe much more gunpowder than high tech microelectronics created second cousin gunpowder said those who had misspent youth making gunpowder know that charcoal briquettes their own burn very slowly added but you grind some briquettes and add saltpeter you have explosive the fine grind the charcoal that makes the difference the chip that surprised mikulec had been etched create dense series microscopic channels introduce magnetic material into the chips researchers the lab poured solution onto the chips that when dried left gadolinium nitrate the channels what the lab had inadvertently created was situation which tiny channels had increased the surface area the silicon much the same way that grinding charcoal does for gunpowder the same time the gadolinium nitrate played the same chemical role saltpeter more properly potassium nitrate although one was hurt that first explosion for greater safety the lab began blowing chips remotely using volt battery and small electrical coil sailor said the researchers found the explosions were very fast and very hot and had about the same force equal amount gunpowder but being chemists they were particularly pleased that the light created the explosions was the ultraviolet portion the spectrum that has helped convince sailor that may possible create portable emission spectrometers for analyzing the chemical composition samples contaminants other compounds such analyzer would burn samples using explosions from the chips the only visible light would produced the chemicals the samples allowing easy and quick analysis and that sailor said would particular value the military dealing with chemical and biological warfare issues don want wait day and half for results from the lab said other labs have created explosions porous silicon wafers said but his view their approaches have practical shortcomings one group used very concentrated nitric acid but that very corrosive said you really don want carry around with you another relies liquid oxygen not the most portable materials among those interested sailor work kristopher pister professor electrical engineering and computer science the university california berkeley his research focuses tiny machines known microelectromechanical systems mems among his projects the development smart dust cubic millimeter mems that carry sensors communications systems and their own power supply exploding silicon said could provide way extracting those tiny sensing units from trouble some our things use optical communications pister said they upside down they don work added that might possible use flaming silicon ignite the solid fuel silicon based microrockets sailor lab the altitude record for exploding chip designed for movement what calls rocket chip about inches movie one chip much shorter journey can viewed online chem faculty ucsd edu sailor rocketchip mov sailor sees the chips greatest potential coming from combining them with mems devices and not just for propulsion among other things hopes that they can act extremely tiny light source power chemical reactions that would analyzed the tiny chips but uncomfortable about the potential application that has attracted the widest attention date theory possible make microprocessors and other integrated circuits from the exploding silicon cell phone laptop computer containing such chips was stolen its owner could send wireless message ordering the device follow the lead the mission impossible tape recorder and self destruct feel horribly embarrassed talking about this sailor said don think there real need have cell phones blow several companies involved computer security and chip making have contacted him about the potential for self destructing chips said but for consumer applications least said the idea has flaws while acknowledging that the ability remotely destroy stolen cell phone might emotionally satisfying sailor said that the least expensive and equally effective method dealing with the problem was simply calling the phone company and canceling service nor would exploding chips solve the problems faced owners missing laptops containing sensitive business government information the explosion sailor said only enough render the chips useless the hard drive and its vital contents would remain intact nevertheless sailor said believed that the military might interested the technology for protecting the secret designs specialized chips nuclear weapons surveillance equipment and other devices the department defense might want this the next time plane goes down china said but protecting your mail that stretch
