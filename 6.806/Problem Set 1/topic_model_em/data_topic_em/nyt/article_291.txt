the bush administration intends announce wednesday new plan dispose surplus american nuclear weapons fuel rejecting part plan the clinton administration too costly under the new plan tons plutonium will converted into fuel for nuclear reactors under the clinton plan eight tons the plutonium were ruined mixing with the waste created when the plutonium was produced the clinton administration decided pursue both routes because was not certain that either one was technically feasible and was eager ensure that had least one method but senior administration official said this evening that dropping the second method would save almost billion the decision was blow opponents nuclear proliferation who say that using recycled plutonium power reactors will send the wrong message countries the united states trying dissuade from purifying plutonium most plutonium produced power reactors and purified from spent fuel can used reactors again but can also end weapons fuel others say the plan will least preserve the heart agreement with the russians destroy like amount their bomb fuel there widespread concern about the security russian nuclear materials the energy secretary spencer abraham expected argue that the new strategy central enhancing national security and advancing nonproliferation goals the senior official said and that technologically possible and affordable but the nuclear control institute nonprofit group based here that seeks prevent the spread nuclear weapons materials and technologies tom clements expert plutonium said that turning the material into reactor fuel will put plutonium into the commercial world security risk and will make harder for the united states discourage other countries from recovering plutonium and reusing reactors elsewhere clements said his organization and others have said that the conversion raises technical and environmental challenges and that the energy department has poor record solving such problems but may solve political problem south carolina gov jim hodges democrat said the plan sounds promising last summer believing that the department was planning ship plutonium savannah river near aiken without plan dispose hodges threatened use state troopers turn the energy department trucks around the state borders nearly all the money for the project will spent south carolina which will make the decision popular locally the department plans pay the duke power use two its twin reactor plants catawba clover and mcguire cornelius take the plutonium fuel but duke must win license amendments from the nuclear regulatory commission and already faces opposition clements organization argues that accident plant using plutonium fuel could release more dangerous materials than one plant using uranium fuel and clements said the new strategy puts all their eggs one basket and might have technical problems but the senior bush administration official said that while people may enthralled with immobilization you want something that keeps the russians their commitment this the way can afford two tracks said referring immobilization and conversion fuel fact cost estimates have varied wildly the estimate was billion but last summer the estimate was billion the administration will say wednesday that eliminating immobilization will save nearly billion and cut the total cost billion the senior official said story can end here optional material follows the clinton plan was dispose tons more than half the national stockpile but that was later reduced tons some the plutonium that was have been mixed with wastes unsuitable for conversion reactor fuel the bush administration will have find two tons weapons plutonium satisfy the agreement with the russians the new plan build two factories the savannah river site government reservation near aiken one will take plutonium pits the heart nuclear warheads remove gallium element with which alloyed and convert from metal oxide form second will mix the plutonium oxide with oxides uranium and turn that into ceramic form the common form for commercial reactor fuel the product called mixed oxide fuel known mox already used europe and japan but production plants have had technical problems and mox far more expensive than uranium
