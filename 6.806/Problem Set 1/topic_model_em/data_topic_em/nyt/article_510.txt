wallabies foxes raccoons skunks snakes tarantulas scorpions turtles lizards all sizes birds and reef fish even bred captivity these wild animals are generally called exotic pets because they have not been intensively and selectively bred for life with humans have domestic pets like dogs cats hamsters and guinea pigs fact many collectors say they are attracted exotic pets because the animals are wild and unusual unspoiled domestication miami los angeles and new york lie the center that trade the united states the largest importer exporter and exporter exotic animals world pet reptiles alone account for around million imports year said simon habel director the north american branch traffic international organization established the world wildlife fund and world conservation union monitor the trade plants and animals meats hides and other animal products traffic estimates the entire trade tens billions dollars year interpol sets the illegal trade billion year second only drugs the often substantial trade within countries largely unmeasured but the dollar figures not reflect the ecological social and health costs wildlife experts said those include driving species toward extinction disrupting ecosystems removing crucial native species and introducing exotics and importing animals with pathogens that can afflict livestock wildlife and humans many animals die during capture and shipment experts calculate that the mortality rate can reach percent percent for some birds and reptiles and percent percent for reef fish demand fuels the trade survey the american pet products manufacturers association found million birds million american households and million reptiles million homes uncounted thousands wild mammals including tigers lions wolves and primates are private hands japan and the european union are also major importers exotic pets habel said defenders the trade exotic pets note that most these animals are bred captivity and are plentiful number virtually all birds legally sold the united states are now captive bred and many ecologists say such programs when well run protect species the wild much the trade perfectly legal operating under the convention international trade endangered species wild fauna and flora cites which involved countries and provides voluntary mechanisms regulate the trade endangered and threatened species additional protections the united states come from the endangered species act and the lacey act which lets officials enforce the conservation laws other countries the wild bird conservation act bans importing wild birds except under narrow circumstances other state local and federal laws are intended regulate the ownership breeding and transportation exotic pets the pet industry which supports captive breeding programs wary further legislation michael maddox chief staff lawyer for the pet industry joint advisory council said reliable surveys proved that the pet trade was contributing significantly the decline any wild species one our big concerns make sure have good handle the problem and reliable numbers before would endorse any kind regulation said but wildlife experts say that many studies showed the trade remained dangerous for many species habitat loss remains the single largest threat species worldwide but for some animals collection just great danger experts said some wildlife biologists suggest that animals become more desirable collectors they become rarer and more expensive parrots turtles tortoises and some lizards are especially hard hit many experts said extensive study the bird trade steven beissinger professor conservation biology the university california berkeley recently reported that the trade exotic pets affected imperiled parrot species them traded legally the spix macaw from brazil now believed extinct the wild hyacinth and blue macaws and red crowned amazons are among other birds considered great risk from the pet trade beissinger said the wild bird conservation act had reduced parrot imports the united states from more than hundreds and had sharply cut poaching caribbean and latin american birds still said some species continue poached unsustainable levels for other markets the greatest threat turtles arises from the food and traditional medicine trades primarily with china and involves millions turtles that represent species from asia said john behler curator herpetology for the wildlife conservation society though claims fewer turtles than the food market the pet trade has devastated number species turtle experts said including all four tortoise species from madagascar the pancake tortoise kenya and tanzania and the egyptian tortoise the removal animals can reverberate throughout ecosystem ecologists said and collecting itself often destroys habitat andrew bruckner coral reef ecologist with the national marine fisheries service said percent the world coral reefs were jeopardy largely from pollution and overexploitation for food fish but some areas bruckner said the harvest fish live rock and coral for reef aquaria are also contributing their decline not all collected species are risk beissinger found that percent the million birds representing species traded worldwide from were nonthreatened finches green iguanas most them raised ranches represented percent reptiles imported into the united states according report last year joseph franke and teresa telecky for the humane society the united states the researchers also found that million farmed north american red eared slider turtles accounted for percent american reptile exports still wildlife experts said those captive bred animals are their nature wild and owning them carries risks story can end here optional material follows the few statistics compiled injuries and fatalities from exotic pets indicate potentially sizable problem philip nyhus assistant professor ecology franklin and marshall college has counted five people killed tigers and seriously hurt since telecky counted average fatalities and illnesses year from reptiles sometimes from bites constriction snakes but usually from salmonella which endemic the gut reptiles and can spread when people touch the animals places they have been comparison fatal attacks humans among the nation million dogs average year health officials advise pregnant women children younger than older people and people with weakened immune systems avoid direct and indirect contact with reptiles exotic animals often carry parasites and pathogens that can devastate livestock native wildlife and humans and many scientists contend that government surveillance and quarantine procedures for most imports are inadequate march the department agriculture did ban imports three african

hundreds fish reptiles amphibians mammals and birds kept exotic pets have gone native the countries where they were taken often establishing breeding populations the detriment native species and ecosystems many experts said the red eared slider turtle banned the european union and south africa invasive species many conservationists argue for reform the trade exotic animals provide greater protections and establish well regulated programs for sustainable harvests the hope that people will protect habitats while earning money many animals are the trade and many are lost said picon the
