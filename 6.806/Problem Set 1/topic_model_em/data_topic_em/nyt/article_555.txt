the climate monitoring station mauna loa volcano hawaii meters above sea level could hardly farther away from all yet even here there escaping the weekly rhythm modern life the observatory records lower concentrations carbon dioxide the atmosphere the weekend than during the week because there known natural cause such seven day cycle randall cerveny arizona state university and kevin coakley the national institute standards and technology boulder colo propose that these observations reflect the weekday bustle and weekend lull hawaii populated regions increased traffic hawaii islands especially the main city hilo the most likely cause carbon dioxide greenhouse gas absorbs and retains solar heat the earth atmosphere vehicles industry and agriculture produce the gas when they burn fossil fuels the main component exhaust fumes could these weekly carbon dioxide cycles cause corresponding variations climate the researchers point out that some climate records already show signs such effects global average temperatures and regional rainfall seem depend small degree the day the week the daily grind established the 1950s the mauna loa weather monitoring station now takes continuous measurements atmospheric carbon dioxide levels help understand how human activities are changing global climate the mauna loa records show steady rise atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over the past few decades modulated annual rise and fall owing seasonal changes the natural sources and sinks the gas caused differences plant growth for instance cyclical changes shorter time scales are harder spot the records because they are usually much weaker than the seasonal oscillations and masked random variations the data cerveny and coakley spotted the weekly cycle calculating the average carbon dioxide levels for each day the week after subtracting out changes owing the seasonal cycle and the gradual yearly rise they find that the measurements rise peak mondays and then decline steadily minimum saturdays crucially the researchers find such cycle carbon dioxide records from the amundsen scott south pole station antarctica which far from any sources pollution the antarctic measurements show the same yearly trend and seasonal cycle but there significant difference between average daily values the researchers reason that the time carbon dioxide pollution reaches antarctica such short term variations have evened out hawaii contrast local pollution levels seem register almost instantly the mauna loa station this article excerpted from new scientist weekly science and technology magazine based london visit http www newscientist com
