cars into cars that will bypass gasoline pumps altogether oil gasoline bush has gone green how about that big oil transferring government subsidies away from additional studies the internal combustion engine bush has pointed the automotive industry toward future when motorists will continue enjoy the same independence and freedom movement except they will not add greenhouse gases depend upon foreign oil imports there nothing wrong with getting more fuel efficient gasoline powered cars the problem that automobile manufacturers engine builders chemical engineers and shade tree mechanics the

fuel and engine mapping along with expensive exotic materials can squeeze bit more efficiency out current internal combustion engines but not much mostly improved vehicle fuel efficiency comes from reducing power size and weight which involve significant trade offs safety comfort and utility rather than pour billion into effort squeeze few more miles per gallon out gasoline fueled cars bush will invest the research and development hydrogen based fuel cells power tomorrow family sedans fuel cells have been around for more than years they have been used successfully nasa space flights they work just that they are not cost effective when compared internal combustion engines hydrogen fuel cells produce energy electrochemically combining hydrogen fuel with oxygen from the air the air free and hydrogen the most abundant element the universe that not enough get your attention hydrogen fuel cells also have zero emissions heat and pure water vapor are the only byproducts hydrogen fuel cell engine say goodbye greenhouse gases many challenges await automobile manufacturers who want sell hydrogen fuel cell cars for starters although hydrogen fuel cell car may percent green hydrogen found combination with other elements such water and fossil fuels hydrogen must manufactured electrolysis steam reforming gasification other methods that drive costs and use energy that not always environmentally friendly hydrogen extremely explosive the hindenburg explosion killed passengers and the promising hydrogen dirigible passenger industry gasoline also extremely explosive but the internal combustion engine known and proven technology the united states has infrastructure for gasoline distribution something similar would have developed for hydrogen fuel cells not have depend hydrogen other fuels will work hydrogen the cleanest fuel efficient fuel cells also could lessen dependence electricity providers bush praiseworthy investment fuel cell amp should expanded include other alternative fuel sources the green thing rowland nethaway senior editor the waco tribune herald story filed cox newspapers friday jan editors the hearst news service will file the following for
