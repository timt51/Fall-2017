miles fowler congregation used call him reverend but the lithonia pastor recently took another title that says fits him much better now bishop miles fowler fowler elevation bishop did not come through the traditional route election appointment church hierarchy the pastor big miller grove baptist church assumed the title himself the lord laid heart become consecrated bishop explains when last looked the scriptures did not see where the lord said should called reverend fowler part curious transformation taking place outside mainstream churches increasing number pastors are giving themselves getting their colleagues the ministry for them status enhancing titles such bishop doctor even apostle the practice particularly popular the african american church some say been sparked the tremendous popularity bishop jakes pastor whose woman thou art loosed revivals and television ministry have made him famous not that many people called themselves bishop until jakes took the title says apostle jamie pleasant the kingdom builders christian center norcross once bishop jakes got everybody wanted bishop and like jakes shrewd businessman known for his marketing savvy these pastors believe that adopting catchy title sets them apart competitive field says riggins earl professor ethics and theology the interdenominational theological center atlanta who earned doctorate from vanderbilt university order compete reverend not enough for their status says even calling themselves doctors doesn enough have find other titles that have more mystical appeal the embracing popular titles raises some troubling questions though today common for public figures like college football coaches political candidates get caught lying about their qualifications ethical for pastors claim names such bishop doctor though they don meet the traditional qualifications that come with those titles that question touches struggle church leaders have had since jesus disciples were first recorded arguing over who was the greatest says alton pollard director the black church studies program emory university who earned doctorate from duke university are seeking the world validation the same time that struggling honored god pollard says tough balancing act freedom improvise this rush elevated religious titles goes deeper however than the success jakes scholars and preachers say some has with the changing demographics african american congregations african american churches are becoming more middle class and educated turn they expect their pastors share their level education with rapidly growing african american middle class there has been expressed need have the clergy feel they par with their membership pollard says yet members african american churches still rarely question pastors about their credentials the reason due tradition the past african american pastors sometimes assumed titles such doc bishop compensation for being denied access higher education and some within the african american community even with its growing middle class accept that tradition today pollard says many still believe white america fails give black ministers the respect they deserve thus some congregations are sympathetic pastors who may not have the credentials but still demonstrate leadership pollard says this person may not actually have the degrees the world says are important but bestow our own sense importance them says but the trend not confined african american churches spreading through churches that fall outside mainline congregations charismatic megachurches and independent congregations archbishop earl paulk for example the white pastor the cathedral the holy spirit decatur assumed his title through nontraditional means bishop from south america gave him the title said church spokeswoman outside mainline churches pastors also have more room improvise they often don have run for election earn advanced academic credentials assume new title like apostle jamie pleasant they can simply say that god gave them their title pleasant the pastor kingdom builders christian center norcross apostle has traditionally been viewed one the disciples who knew jesus during his earthly ministry paul converted shortly afterward yet pleasant who has marketing from georgia tech but seminary training says apostle literally means one who sent god points the apostle paul example who did not know jesus the flesh pleasant says that like paul was personally appointed jesus says jesus literally appeared him one day laid his hands him and said you are apostle pleasant says doesn feel need attend seminary gets confused about biblical translation uses computer software that translates greek and hebrew his church now has members says say this humbly have very high says doctor another title pastors have been assuming for years creflo dollar the pastor the second largest church metro atlanta world changers church international too was addressed pastor recently two years ago not anymore now calls himself creflo dollar dollar however has never graduated from seminary has bachelor degree education from the state university west georgia earned doctorate religion dollar new title said church spokeswoman comes from another source received honorary degree from oral roberts university henry mitchell atlanta author and one the country leading authorities african american church culture says the practice common mitchell who holds earned doctorates theology and divinity says there are many pastors who call themselves doctor after receiving honorary degree preachers even have nickname for the degrees there are lot donated dignity doctorates says everybody and their brother want have doctorate different definition the title bishop though the most coveted among this new breed pastors but what precisely bishop depends whom you ask mainstream churches bishops are elected appointed church hierarchy the idea person declaring himself herself bishop verges heresy you really implying that you becoming authority unto yourself says earl the interdenominational theological center you were the early church the bishop was appointed the whole thing was affirmed and recognized the community faith you don appoint yourself says yet there another definition bishop that becoming more popular the new breed bishops cite passages the new testament such those the first book timothy where pastor described bishop overseer they say the new testament doesn use the word reverend but bishop bishop eddie long pastor the largest church the metro area the best known converted bishop the area was consecrated bishop the full gospel baptist church fellowship relatively new movement within african american baptist churches that embraces pentecostal beliefs long pastor new birth missionary baptist church lithonia says calls himself bishop because the bible says bishops oversee other pastors well long says offers guidance least other pastors the bishop pastor pastor says someone who recognized for their ability cover other ministries some may ask what important about assuming the title reverend bishop but assuming the title bishop offers distinct advantage for pastor more power reverends traditionally have answer deacon boards other church groups bishops have more autonomy fowler says longer has answer board deacons who would hire and fire will not having any authority over other than the lord with and congregation have the power change whatever need change within the church without having get approved any other person fowler says hodges deacon fowler church says the change his pastor title meant little him don really look names and titles says they don have bearing look the service the man has rendered gospel story some outsiders may question why churches accept pastors changing titles some don churches split some cases members leave the christian tradition however ultimately teaches that those who seek worldly titles elevate themselves are betraying the example jesus earl says one the most famous passages the gospels earl says jesus washes the feet his disciples the night before his execution the foot washing function then performed slaves was used jesus introduce new style leadership was against those who have need lord over people with their titles earl says radically turned
