since the suicidal terrorist attacks sept some experts nuclear security are increasingly concerned that intruders could break into weapons plants assemble nuclear bomb from materials there and explode the spot critics security procedures energy department weapons plants say intruders might use conventional explosives blow nuclear waste uranium plutonium sending radioactive materials into areas nearby they may try create actual nuclear bomb building high yield nuclear weapon requires substantial skill with metal working and explosives but starting chain reaction relatively easy government bomb builders have accidentally done several times over the years with some training terrorists might produce chain reaction using uranium way that created substantial explosion some experts say ron timm former energy department security official said that some cases assembling bomb could done without explosives bringing uranium parts together manually flying lot more sophisticated than what discussing here said timm author report issued october the project government oversight watchdog group that traces history security problems the weapons plants the report recommends consolidating nuclear materials now held sites and putting security for the materials under the direction independent oversight agency instead the department energy scientist not associated with the report frank von hippel who physicist and professor public and international affairs princeton said telephone interview that pound mass uranium dropped second pound mass from height about feet could produce blast kilotons the hiroshima bomb which used uranium was kilotons even blast only one kiloton said would destroy area about one square mile but finding the right amounts uranium could still challenge said nuclear fuel stored wide variety buildings and previous security reviews have found that some vulnerable theft rep edward markey mass and longtime critic the energy department plans raise the issue publicly wednesday news conference where several current and former energy department workers will describe security lapses letter the energy secretary spencer abraham which markey said would send wednesday argues that suicidal terrorists may try rapidly propelling two masses weapons grade plutonium uranium towards one another create critical mass using conventional explosives that how the hiroshima bomb was detonated experts point out scientists said that plutonium bomb could built with much smaller quantity material than uranium bomb but that would probably begin chain reaction before the parts could moved into position resulting nuclear blast that would not very powerful the first plutonium bombs tested the trinity site new mexico and then used nagasaki had elaborate arrangements explosives squeeze the mass together and hold there long enough for the chain reaction become sufficiently established markey letter cites cases which nuclear weapons laboratories and manufacturing plants have failed security drills conducted navy seals and other commandos playing the part terrorists for example drill los alamos national laboratory the terrorists used garden cart steal enough weapons grade uranium for numerous nuclear weapons report cited markey says but john gordon retired air force general who undersecretary energy for national security expressed confidence security after sept put the folks higher alert and they working very aggressively said think doe weapons site one the last places terrorist would think about attacking and having hopes success the security basically bristles gordon said attackers sometimes prevailed security drills because sometimes run them failure want find out where the system would break down and run stuff that guaranteed lose the end said after each one them strengthen security the energy department has been concerned since least about the possibility terrorists using its materials build bomb site but timm and others said questioned whether suicidal terrorists were likely threat business glance new york times news service amazon com posts profit helped efficiency drive after losing billion since was founded amazon com
