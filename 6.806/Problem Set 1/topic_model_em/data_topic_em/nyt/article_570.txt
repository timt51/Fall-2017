bonuses our economic recession mild and vastly different from what experienced the late 80s yet the decline tax revenues comparable what saw then said mike widmer president the massachusetts taxpayers foundation the principal reason the huge drop off taxes that were tied the stock market using estimates from economics professor alan clayton matthews and the state executive office for administration and finance the globe calculated that state revenue from these stock market related taxes will plunge from billion million this year one consultant who does forecasting for state governments said massachusetts could forced chop billion billion annually from its budget over the next three four years and that most isn ever going come back billion budget that would much percent drop spending looks like the economy will bounce back starting some time around summer said moscovitch cape ann economics gloucester can therefore expect return growth rate state revenue that were before the answer capital gains taxes taxes paid when investor sells stock that has appreciated value soared from million more than billion last year the financial markets are expected grow more slowly over the next decade than they did the mid late 1990s and massachusetts has now fully phased change that makes investments held six years more immune the capital gains tax likely long time before capital gains revenue tops the billion level again the late 1990s were probably once lifetime event far the market concerned said mark zandi chief economist economy com forecasting firm west chester that juiced everything unprecedented heights that won see again for many years maybe even decades but capital gains aren the only disappearing vestige the boom state revenue exercised stock options and employee bonuses also paralleled the run stock prices and are now following the financial markets into tax oblivion david wetherell chief executive the internet firm cmgi inc andover reported shareholders last

when cmgi stock was trading for about per share even though wetherell said never sold any those shares had pay immediate withholding taxes the difference value this example per share estimating the total tax revenue generated options and market related bonuses though difficult with precision since they reported ordinary income and not broken out separately like capital gains clayton matthews professor the university massachusetts boston attempts track tax revenue from exercised stock options and bonuses monitoring lump sum payments state revenue that captures withholding taxes from sources that don appear every paycheck primarily bonuses and exercised stock options most lump sum payments come the end the year the beginning the year during what clayton matthews calls bonus season during the mid 1990s lump sum income reported state tax returns totaled about billion during most bonus seasons which equates about million tax revenue for the state since was taxed percent the end the decade taxpayers were reporting more than billion each year lump sum payments which generated almost million despite tax rates that had then fallen percent clayton matthews said anticipates that the figures could return what saw the mid 1990s after couple years and then level off but capital gains taxes continued are unlikely come back anywhere near those magnitudes for the foreseeable future for many years that analysis proves correct state budget makers are facing the long term loss million more revenue from capital gains and another million from stock options and bonuses lawmakers set aside billion during the good years reserve fund which they can now tap help cover the shortfall widmer the taxpayers foundation said that was smart move that took great restraint the part elected officials but that will dwindle quickly given the expected funding shortfalls this year and next also said that many beacon hill haven yet adjusted the new reality that much the tax revenue not going come back soon the economy turns around you live the sword you die the sword widmer said now dying paying very high price for building those incredible capital gains into our growth expectations and for not anticipating just how steep the fall was going robert costrell research director administration and finance acknowledged the difficulty figuring our how much the revenue drop will return and
