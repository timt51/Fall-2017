feels overcalculated writer director todd solondz set out make movie people would find more provocative and alienating than happiness his previous film happiness which featured pedophile and gratuitous displays body fluids proved controversial that its distributor dropped the movie eventually was released unrated different company solondz wanted top that had his work cut out for him does top storytelling likely will fuel countless arguments among filmgoers but does accentuating traits many people found off putting about his previous movies almost enough make solondz partisan evaluate his other work for the record liked happiness and his earlier welcome the dollhouse yes solondz showed little compassion for his characters and extension the segment society from which they were drawn white middle class suburbanites still those movies were trenchant and funny works social criticism they made uneasy but that valid artistic strategy storytelling however solondz tries too hard make squirm its most awkward moments feels like movie the farrelly brothers would make only they were intellectuals instead mere smarty pants the film divided into two sections labeled fiction and nonfiction both sections are concerned with the construction and interpretation narrative and with issues exploitation the first set college creative writing workshop solondz sets the tone with the first scene the film opens with two college students having passionate sex one the lovely selma blair whom can tell gooder from her slogan blaring shirts not her choice sexual partners her lover marcus leo fitzpatrick who has cerebral palsy marcus smart enough know with him only because his affliction and not above using means keeping her wringing sympathy they break over her inability either truthfully evaluate his writing which frankly stinks defend him when criticized class setting out one night seeking hit and run sex with stranger winds with their imperious teacher african american man who seems contemptuous everyone there are many ways interpret their sexual encounter there are interpreters does scott robert wisdom cruelly and unconscionably exploit are his actions justifiable angry response the racial stereotyping and fantasies believes led her his bedroom does solondz portrait scott feed into noxious stereotypes the brutal hypersexual black male the filmmaker intentionally holding the stereotype force audience members confront their own attitudes and what did she get what she wanted was she silly uncomprehending racist who got the comeuppance she deserved hard tell solondz mocking white liberal guilt merely trying get rise out while having cold impersonal sex scott orders utter racial slur which she does first reluctantly then with rising intensity knowing whether she raises her voice anger passion both would help interpret the scene but can see her because solondz places large red block over the couple the filmmaker says obscured the scene because the movie ratings board refused give him rating unless made cuts opposed would have believe the red block political statement that may true certainly makes wonder given the explicit sex other rated movies whether the ratings board would have objected had the racial element not been present but how know the red block isn just ploy generate controversy and get attention the second story nonfiction longer about shoe store salesman named toby paul giamatti who decides make documentary about teen agers gloms onto sullen youth scooby mark webber new jersey high school scooby and his parents john goodman and julie hagerty cooperate with the documentary expecting favorable portrayal the first story isn easy for the audience decide whom sympathize with everyone the family except scooby overly concerned with social standing and they treat the hispanic maid horribly solondz uses toby character mock his own image criticisms people make solondz that deliberately portrays his characters and suburban life the cruelest light also apply toby opportunist with artistic pretensions both sections storytelling raise intriguing questions about who exploiting whom and about the nature creative expression they seem disconnected but they address some the same issues stories however they both feel thin solondz combined them into one movie and minutes short one because lost interest fleshing them out one the most interesting things about storytelling that directs our thoughts both inward consider issues central the creation and interpretation art and outward reflect race social values sex and economics hard think another american film that does that another american filmmaker except perhaps spike lee who would attempt that storytelling has value cannot denied not even solondz thirst for controversy sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed cheapening storytelling starring selma blair leo fitzpatrick robert wisdom noah fleiss paul giamatti john goodman julie hagerty director screenwriter todd solondz contains strong sexual content language and some drug use running time minutes grade new york times news service for thursday pms here are the
