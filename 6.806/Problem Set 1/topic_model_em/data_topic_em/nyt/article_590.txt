the new york times said editorial for monday feb president bush grand design for reducing america vulnerability terrorism lacks one obvious and critical piece realistic strategy for reducing america crippling reliance imported oil especially petroleum from the persian gulf reducing our dependence gulf oil would increase our flexibility the war terrorism and other areas foreign policy well the bush administration took the most practical approach and explored new methods energy conservation the effort could also yield important technological gains and reduce america unconscionably large contribution global warming right now the united states uses percent the world oil production even though has only percent the world population and percent its reserves two thirds world reserves more than billion barrels belong the nations the persian gulf matter how many holes are punched american soil simply cannot drill our way energy independence the route lies elsewhere buying oil from many different nations would help point compared with its allies the united states already has advantage this regard the gulf supplies only one quarter total imports percent the total consumption billion barrels year hemispheric neighbors like canada and mexico supply well over percent and they could asked for more africa remains important source while other potential suppliers are ramping production together russia azerbaijan and kazakhstan have more than percent the world proven oil reserves more than the united states and canada combined and exploration the former soviet union continuing diversification though has its limits not only most the planet oil located the persian gulf but that where america allies which not have substantial reserves their own must turn find the bulk their imports that won change even the united states finds alternative sources for itself the surest road greater energy independence disciplined program energy efficiency coupled with major effort develop renewable nonpetroleum sources this the road jimmy carter started after the oil shocks the 1970s leading fuel economy standards for cars and trucks yet bush continues put his chips alarmingly unbalanced house bill that provides billion subsidies for traditional energy sources and only billion for conservation our quarrel not with bush desire find more domestic oil there are untapped resources areas like the gulf mexico that have long been open for drilling and vice president dick cheney energy task force noted may able double our reserves using new technologies older fields could also far more with alaska huge natural gas reserves which could pumped southward along the route the existing trans alaska pipeline and used substitute for oil our quarrel rather with bush fixation the arctic national wildlife refuge well other ecologically sensitive areas and with the impression leaves that can somehow drill our way out dependency blinded its ties the drillers the administration cannot will not concede that conservation the more reliable path self sufficiency and that aggressive investments new technologies can smooth that path the numbers are clear increasing fuel efficiency standards miles gallon reasonable expectation even with existing technology would save about million barrels day that about five times what the arctic refuge expected yield and turns out roughly the same amount our present imports from the persian gulf important members bush own party like sen john mccain are pushing increases fuel economy yet bush devoted only one line conservation his state the union address and his policy initiatives are modest mystifying recently for example energy secretary spencer abraham announced program develop hydrogen powered car hydrogen may well the fuel the future but abraham also took the occasion downgrade demonstrably useful program develop efficient hybrid cars the near term part because annoyed the automobile industry bush should using his current political capital seize all available strategies decrease america dependence foreign oil
