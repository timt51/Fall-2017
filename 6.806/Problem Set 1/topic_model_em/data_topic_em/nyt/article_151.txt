business regulatory actions that were hardly noticed the post sept world allowing more roads and power line construction public lands weakening rules over mining permits delaying ban snowmobiles national parks letting developers build wetlands without replacing them the question does anyone care time war and recession politically safe ignore the environment the answer appears that not safe and that this administration knows and for that reason the president last week also signed agreement ensure that water reached the florida everglades important political matter important swing state and visited abandoned industrial plant suburban philadelphia where announced money help clean and develop such sites across the country pennsylvania course another important swing state that has

environmental administration portray itself green via photo ops this was the same administration after all that wanted open the arctic national wildlife refuge oil drilling and that the person vice president dick cheney had dismissed the idea that conservation could help reduce the nation energy needs contemptuously dismissing mere sign personal virtue nor was only committed environmentalists who distrusted the bush administration these matters before sept polls showed that voters particularly independents suburbanites and women saw the president beholden his like minded friends the extractive industries oil gas coal timber and mining bush and his advisers seemed finally comprehend the depth their problem when the public erupted over their pronouncements arsenic the administration seemed ready allow higher level the poison drinking water than the clinton administration had recommended bush later called this one the biggest public relations disasters his short tenure and while the administration would continue take actions that critics considered anti environmental tempered those with moves calculated placate voters sept the administration defused the issue

health and recognizes that pollute the air kids are going get asthma and doesn matter are war the peculiar thing that while the administration clearly attuned the political power the environment some its actions continue suggest heedless disregard that knowledge critics said that the president and vice president seemed wedded the part industry that favored fossil fuel extraction partly because their backgrounds this president and his closest friends come not from business but from particular element business said mark mellman democratic pollster who convinced the environment will play
