the morning sept terrorists were hijacking four commercial airliners three the democratic party top strategists were having breakfast with small group political reporters downtown washington hotel james carville robert shrum and stan greenberg came armed with polling data suggesting that the bush administration was flailing about with little connection the everyday concerns americans the public was lukewarm toward the new president tax cuts concerned about his close ties corporate america wary his plans drill for oil pristine wilderness alaska doubtful his commitment health care and social security reforms and anxious about the downward spiral the economy but the most astounding finding was that percent believed george bush who came the oval office with frat boy underachiever reputation was over his head the country leader even his worst days with the iran hostage crisis and double digit inflation jimmy carter never had numbers approaching this level greenberg told the reporters all all the democratic strategists concluded the elections looked like good year for democrats chance for the party expand their one seat edge the senate overtake the republicans seat majority the house and with states electing governors add the statehouses controlled the party before the breakfast was over however one the hijacked planes had slammed into one the towers the world trade center new york the group was leaving the hotel word came that another plane had hit the other tower and before they got back their offices third plane had slammed into the pentagon fourth had crashed into the pennsylvania countryside and america was war the war afghanistan and the soaring popularity brought the president have created political landscape that radically different from what has gone before carville shrum and greenberg readily acknowledge now nonetheless they maintain their latest strategy memo democrats that still moment opportunity for the party long democrats focus primarily domestic issues primarily the economy the environment and health care excepting franklin roosevelt democrats party controlling the white house has picked seats first midterm election since the civil war the average loss dozen seats just what the democrats need reinforcing that historical pattern the state the economy there have been eight periods economic contraction since six the eight occurred during midterm election all with republican the white house and those elections the average number house seats lost the president party has been the gop banked offsetting the historic trends with round post census redistricting that leave house republicans with more favorable district boundaries but gains from redistricting have been offset republican retirements far compared only six democrats independent analysts say the republicans can still find hope this year complex political dynamics powerful the historical patterns appear least today things are stacking way that suggest history will not repeat itself political newsletter publisher charles cook informed his subscribers this week for instance this fall senate races also appear favor the democrats they are defending just seats compared for the gop but the democratic incumbents may more vulnerable five them won last time with percent less the vote compared only four the republicans similarly the democrats must defend only governorships this fall while the republicans have statehouses hold but the presidential election bush outperformed gore the states with gubernatorial races this year carrying percent the states with democratic governors while gore was winning percent gop controlled states even the democrats good luck may work against them this fall former republican national committee strategist john pitney now political science professor california said that last year defection sen jim jeffords vermont from the republican party costing his former party control the senate strips the democrats potent argument when one party controls the white house and both chambers congress easy for the out party blame everything the party and argue that need balance the government but with split party control congress the balance arguably there already said the end says cook the fall elections may fought remarkably level playing field with the quality candidates and the amount campaign funding playing pivotal roles consequently both parties have been raising campaign money record levels the democratic senatorial campaign committee reported this week that raised record breaking million last year its republican counterpart the national republican congressional committee has not yet made public its total but raised million the first six months last year story can end here optional add follows despite the president popularity and the accompanying rise his party standing polls since sept show the public evenly divided party identification republican pollster bill mcinturff has cautioned that the economy bush soft underside another gop pollster frank luntz also cautions that the president and his party have until labor day demonstrate the soundness their fiscal policies what needs happen said perceived recovery the economy least two months before the elections still democrats have been emboldened the election democratic governors virginia and new jersey last fall replacing republicans both states right now you have democratic governors from mississippi the east coast new jersey said from the founder and director the democratic leadership council the promoter the moderate new democrat ideology anybody had predicted that two years ago they would have been laughed democratic strategists analyzing the virginia and new jersey races have concluded that their best approach the midterm election continue their steadfast support for the president his war terrorism but challenge him and his fellow republicans host domestic issues particularly the economy for example radio commercial sponsored the democratic congressional campaign committee last month against against rep john shimkus ill preview what likely come the charged that the administration backed economic stimulus package shimkus voted for congress last year was actually attempt pass billions dollars tax breaks for huge corporations shimkus responded with his own commercial since september america has united never before unfortunately that not always the case politics now not the time for partisanship bickering rather time pull together pursue justice abroad and repair our economy here home but partisanship what fuels elections and despite the unity over the war terrorism there sign that the tone washington has changed much from elections past democrats are accusing the president worsening the recession with tax cuts that favor the wealthy republicans are accusing the democrats wanting tax and spend and the president vowing that taxes will increased over dead body the perfect storm white house budget
