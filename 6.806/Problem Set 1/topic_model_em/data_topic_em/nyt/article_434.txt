while the popularity and sales sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks surged causing the average mile per gallon for vehicles drop the fuel economy the average new automobile sold the united states fell its lowest point more than years and cars had been eclipsed the point that cadillac now making pickup trucks how the vehicles american roads will shift this decade will determined part debate over fuel consumption under way washington senate democrats are circulating ambitious preliminary proposal that would raise fuel economy standards about percent but many legislators and lobbyists wonder whether this latest plan has any better chance success than previous democratic plans considering the republican house and white house last friday the bush administration sought pre empt the senate when transportation secretary norman mineta sent letter congress that asked for the authority revamp the current system regulations over the years authority fuel economy has been passed between the national highway traffic safety administration branch the transportation department and congress depending where concerned parties thought they could get the best hearing now because congress closely divided and run democrats the senate and they control the administrative strings they want nhtsa said sen john kerry mass who chairman the commerce committee hearings into the issue added that the president chief staff andrew card pushed for the republican congress handle fuel economy issues when served general motors top lobbyist the clinton administration bush administration officials counter that they are serious about increasing automotive fuel economy though they have offered details how much oil they intend save and when they want start saving because nhtsa has been prevented congress from looking into the issue for much the 1990s the agency new administrator jeffrey runge says does not know enough offer any specifics yet the agency reviewing recent study from the national academy sciences that suggested significant fuel economy increases were achievable but also cautioned that previous improvements led manufacturers make lighter vehicles that could less safe but that review going take lot time runge said the safety issue has been the focus detroit criticism increasing the existing fuel standards environmentalists and democrats contend that improvements are already being made with technologies that don lighten vehicles from more efficient tires hybrid engines that use combination electric and gasoline power are very serious about supporting and improving fuel economy runge said also very serious about the safety effects whatever the fuel economy standards look like and that frankly priority the differences between democratic and republican approaches already the table are significant the current senate proposal circulated democratic staff members seeks save million barrels day model year when its effects are fully phased into the automotive fleet roughly third the amount gas consumed today passenger vehicles and more than the imports from saudi arabia the house energy bill sought trim gas use billion gallons oil two weeks consumption between model years and about barrels oil day renewed focus oil consumption since sept has some senate republicans like john mccain talking energy security the united states produces about percent the world oil and consumes quarter disparity exacerbated last year when sales light trucks minivans sport utility vehicles and pickups exceeded passenger cars for the first time ever the record was potent symbol how much more gas american automobiles consume than those sold europe and asia but between afghanistan enron and the economy fuel consumption not the top many agendas ford chrysler and have all become increasingly dependent sales light trucks for their survival and year when overall industry sales are expected shrink there apprehension about tougher regulation ford and chrysler unit daimlerchrysler both project breaking even their goal this year and many analysts are skeptical even that can achieved story can end here optional material follows when corporate average fuel economy standards called cafe regulators were first enacted after the energy shocks the 1970s about one every five new vehicles sold was truck and the standards were split between trucks considered work vehicles and passenger cars which included station wagons under current cafe standards each automaker light truck fleet required average miles gallon compared with miles gallon for their passenger car fleet the big three oppose any increase these fuel standards the united automobile workers union would accept increase standards under certain conditions and honda and toyota are more amenable because they are already further ahead far the administration positions have been sync with the big three the energy department scrapped clinton administration research consortium into highly fuel efficient vehicles which had mixed results and replaced with program that will fund one the furthest off areas research hydrogen powered fuel cells that would replace internal combustion engines while environmental groups agree with the industry that fuel cells offer solution there concern that the auto industry are pushing very futuristic answer way avoid near term fuel economy improvements the outcome the latest debate will have significant effect the kinds cars and trucks the road how many each there will and whether emerging technologies like hybrids will more than niche products the recent north american international auto show here several possible futures were display from there was the hummer dressed but still hulking version the hummer military transport from ford there was the mighty tonka concept vehicle that offers pinocchio like transformation one hasbro tonka toys into real life horsepower pickup among the giants was also new version honda civic that will sold april little different the naked eye from previous civics save for chunky orange cord curled around the engine the civic hybrid will get nearly miles gallon percent more than normal civic will also about more expensive than comparable gas civic though toyota and honda are already selling hybrids the civic hybrid will the first several hybrid versions brand names vehicles released over the next couple years including least one from each the big three one proposal the table supported kerry provide consumers thousands dollars tax credits make the difference for buying hybrid policy makers both sides agree that under the current system hybrids will likely remain niche vehicles and trucks will continue rule the road
