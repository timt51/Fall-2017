one the truly gut wrenching questions most people lives why buy sell home now real estate very psychological phenomenon said robert campbell professor real estate finance hofstra university whose bachelor degree from yale was psychology just talk somebody who buying for the first time and someone going through trauma frightening event big risk big investment campbell said means you going move taking all your money and more and putting into house more because you taking out mortgage into that standard tangle psychological tremors recent events have infused even greater degree uncertainty the stories the new york region manic residential real estate market the frenzied bidding wars tales fisticuffs the front lawn the champagne and brie bragging rites over newly snared penthouse the trauma the turndown have abated bit the more sobering circumstances the last five months yet now the past market observers from those wandering the halls higher learning the numbers crunchers their spreadsheets the brokers the phone still wonder what goes the minds potential home buyers recent years their hunches have come under more careful systematic scrutiny there increasingly prominent wrinkle the study economics something beyond the numbers the psychology finances the field real estate economics may well have surfaced the 50s with research paper that has long been considered classic that paper pure theory local expenditures charles tiebout economics professor northwestern university postulated that potential suburbanites really buy community first the package local services the schools their sense the neighborhood and then the house that observation perhaps not surprising now but those were the days when suburbs were just beginning encroach vast tracts farmland before they had become sprawling concern these days such studies fall under new designation behavioral finance discipline that looks macroeconomic concepts like loss aversion theory why people buy sell differently depending whether the market going down and price anchoring how during boom the recently outlandish price soon becomes acceptable and looks how micro you wouldn believe how peculiarly personal factors can sometimes influence home buying behavior broker tells woman who insists living near dairy barn harvard professor has written book titled sex and real estate the fireplace deal breaker was during the big real estate boom the late 1980s the one preceding the big boom the late 1990s and early 2000s that two economics professors were introduced mutual friend who knew they were both musing over the same question how buyers behave boom and postboom markets together they surveyed hundreds buyers across the country the answers were remarkably insipid actually said robert shiller yale university who with karl case wellesley college conducted the study they would report what they saw while driving shiller said things like there much traffic here many cars everybody wants live california and getting crowded prices have they would repeat stories about how hot the market was houses selling the first day and express anxiety that don buy now won able afford one later but nobody quoted any numbers any population extrapolations shiller said our uniform impression was that these buying decisions were not based careful analysis real people and the decision buy house inherently very emotional one while market players and observers obviously cannot quantify those individually internal factors they all agree that the housing market driven least much psychology economic fundamentals the same time personal though buying decisions may there certainly have been broadly embracing national and regional mood swings the market over the decades notes james hughes dean the edward bloustein school planning and public policy rutgers people respond least the short term cyclical swings and external shocks hughes said but the long term housing has always bounced back one the more ebullient sectors the economy the early 70s with inflation climbing housing was seen much better investment than stocks hughes said certainly better than your passbook savings account which had lower interest rate than inflation the psychology built that housing was the super piggy bank but from with the united states energy crisis housing slumped people had been moving into bigger houses hughes said the fear was whether those would turn out white elephants due the higher heating and cooling costs pessimism seeped deep into the market for average sized homes well had double digit mortgage rates plus percent hughes said people wondered about the death the american dream house real estate would roar again particularly our region the professor said had the great boom from and housing experienced probably its biggest price rise ever according the federal office housing enterprise oversight home prices across the nation jumped percent from and the new york region they skyrocketed percent housing ownership replaced sex everyday fantasy hughes said was the subject white wine and brie parties how much did the house down the street sell for what property worth now then came the worst recession for the region since the great depression lasted months the northeast through opposed eight months for most the nation during the boom years hughes said the new york region had built year supply office space speculation and that was true even for big condo and town house complexes that was followed vast bankruptcies among developers the collapse the amp industry then during the post recession early 90s housing was held more shelter than investment the notion was don overinvest housing said and people obviously put lot money into the stock market yet housing kept creeping back and prices reached and then surpassed their peak housing again became major obsession hughes said nowhere more than manhattan according one leading survey the insignia douglas elliman market report the median price for apartments manhattan increased percent percent and less than percent and when the stock market started tank year ago housing proved even greater winner hughes said was the safe port the economic storm story can end here optional material follows barbara corcoran one manhattan leading brokers and boosters has phrase for the frenzy that fuels booms pack mentality everybody likes buy when everybody buying and nobody likes buy when one buying said corcoran the chairwoman corcoran group pack mentality starts with shift buyers market which soon becomes snowball and then avalanche into sellers market corcoran said the craziness that everyone buying with their hearts and justifying with their heads they think but all really buying the crowd actuality the opposite she said smart people buy near the bottom when the market bottoms very few people have the courage out there and they are they the ones that make the steal deal shiller yale author that 1980s study buyer behavior argues that the media play part fueling pack mentality the media are promulgating optimistic stories shiller said not saying biased they report both sides but people are receptive the optimistic stories they just get more attention the stories people paying more than the asking price selling the first day house listed fistfights the front lawn said they great stories they resonate and they get repeated word mouth there natural process boom market which sustains the market for while and during the boom according behavioral finance theory phenomenon called anchoring comes into play when people have come with number for how much something worth they are easily influenced other numbers that they hear shiller said anchoring means that whatever value something has recently surpassed soon starts sound reasonable volatile market prices have gone lot said people think wouldn pay much for that house but hey might more pay much more than would have otherwise new york people say the prices are outrageous shiller said but they seen before starts seem they buy anyway because nobody really knows what the price should unfortunately that only works when prices are going added for sellers the primary psychological motivation loss aversion even the face current market conditions people make financial decisions differently assets that have declined value opposed assets that have increased value said chris mayer professor real estate the university pennsylvania wharton school mayer author with david genesove hebrew university jerusalem loss aversion and seller behavior evidence from the housing market article the november quarterly journal economics let say bought house and the housing market has gone percent mayer said now thinking selling and maybe somebody makes offer for gain percent typical homeowner would look that and say hey did pretty well but that homeowner actually did worse than the market still mayer continued they got offer for percent appreciation they would likely take and happy the key that decision the professor pointed out that the seller benchmark what she paid for the house not some index how houses that market have done recently down market the seller would probably react differently let say prices fall percent mayer said the seller got offer from someone buy for percent below what they paid matter how long before they would very likely turn down the offer and leave the house the market the hopes getting better offer this behavior odd most economists because believe people should benchmark performance against market indicator said the person who receives offer percent gain over their original price will view themselves being successful even though they done worse than the market but the homeowner where the market went down percent and the offer only percent down they will actually have outperformed the market what that means for the real estate market that least the start downturn many overpriced houses remain the market prices are sticky believe not that old economics term meaning they stay high even when demand has fallen mayer said eventually the number houses the market grows and the number closed deals declines sellers revise their prices downward many sellers however never drop their asking price enough and eventually withdraw from the market then when there new upturn houses start selling quickly because sellers are again accepting offers based what they paid sometimes decades ago and not the current market value loss aversion confounds classic economic calculations for the housing market too does the fact that pricing statistics are often months out date yet subject more recent mood swings real estate markets are very inefficient setting prices mayer said that because the comps the comparables used buyers and sellers are old news people look sales that went contract six nine months ago order determine today asking price you thought about buying selling stock you wouldn decide how much share ibm worth looking the closing price six months ago said but that what people real estate all the time and then they subject those numbers current interpretations jonathan miller president miller samuel the appraisal company that prepares the elliman market report strives for statistical understatement yet admits that his business kind verbal inflation can color the numbers brother law research scientist ohio and sent list tongue cheek translations official sounding statistical phrases that been floating around the internet miller said thought would apply real estate and agree the list includes phrases like case after case which then defines really meaning twice the phrase series cases really thrice definite trend evident code for these data are practically meaningless miller believes the internet has created some contradictory effects real estate dealings with the ease computing and the advent desktop publishing said there tremendous amount information available buyers and sellers and the people they depend the broker the mortgage broker the banker the appraiser all have access much more information the market much more sophisticated the other hand information certainly can presented impressive format that looks official that made look pretty with fancy charts and graphs miller said but often there isn much behind small number transactions they mean nothing and often what buyers and sellers with those statistics depends what influencing them the time said their emotional state his own interpretation miller said the mind set now the current recession significantly different than the last recession call that recession the glass half empty period and now glass half full period whatever the numbers there
