the terrorist attack that destroyed the world trade center last september exposed new yorkers downwind the most hazardous plumes extremely fine chemical and metal particles that experts have ever seen university california scientists reported monday the twin towers collapsed into flaming rubble after they were hit two hijacked airliners wind gusts continued sending thick clouds containing millions the particles for weeks afterward the unprecedented pollution was far worse than that from the kuwait oil field fires set iraq during the gulf war the soot filled air from beijing wintertime coal burning furnaces said davis researcher thomas cahill specialist analyzing airborne particles who led team investigating the catastrophe consequences for the department energy those particles downwind over new york were like nothing ever seen anywhere cahill said interview monday and his colleagues released preliminary report the team findings cahill heads the davis delta caps group the term stands for detection and evaluation long range transport aerosols that has analyzed particulate hazards all over the world the particles were really weird they came great big spikes when the wind blew then they die down then spike again and the particles that aren soluble like silicon from burning glass are the ones that can lodge your lungs and irritate them badly and stay there said emphysema asthma other lung diseases and even heart disease are among the health problems that can aggravated caused pollutant particles that lodge the lungs workers the site have complained variety maladies pin down the nature the particles from the burning twin towers rubble cahill recruited researchers from million advanced light source facility the lawrence berkeley national laboratory for precise ray images the tiny particles and lawrence livermore national laboratory for that facility ion microscopy and proton scattering devices last oct the team mounted particle collecting air monitor rooftop varick manhattan mile north northeast the trade center complex and samples were shipped back regularly davis through the end december yesterday report covered the period through the end october although standards set the environmental protection agency for analyzing particle size their density their composition and their hazards differ somewhat from the delta group the differences are largely technical cahill team collected particle samples ranging size from coarse microns about the diameter the period the end this sentence ultra fine less than tenth that diameter their weight was measured nanograms billionths gram the ruins the twin towers became screamingly hot chemical reactor cahill said and for weeks even the flames eased and the core the towers cooled below degrees the steel was still glowing red degrees november and clouds particles were still rising those particles simply shouldn have been there because rained heavily for six days september after the attack and the coarse particles should have settled down but they were probably still being generated from the heat the pile debris among the fine and very fine metal particles rising from the rubble for which the epa has set health guidelines are iron from the girders titanium from the concrete vanadium and nickel possibly associated with burning fuel oil well copper and zinc lead particles most likely from the thousands computers the towers and mercury from the building electrical circuits were detected low concentrations cahill reported the analysts found relatively few pulverized asbestos fibers from the debris said probably because the twin towers contractors stopped using asbestos half way through construction the story buildings which were completed and now cahill said the evidence indicates that the air over new york city longer affected world trade center disaster because the fires are out and the debris pile has cooled california state and local officials already had been surveying members the state urban search and rescue teams after receiving reports health problems among some those members after they returned from new york according menlo park fire protection district capt harold schapelhouman the team members who went new york percent had reported being sick upon their return those percent reported chronic cough and percent reported pneumonia the team now conducting more depth surveys and schapelhouman says working with fema coordinate nationwide health survey rescue team members schapelhouman says plans send information about the davis study his own affected team members well other teams across the country all these guys want kept the loop they want know what said they would all again but they took the chances and they deserve know the truth chronicle staff writer matthew stannard contributed this report
