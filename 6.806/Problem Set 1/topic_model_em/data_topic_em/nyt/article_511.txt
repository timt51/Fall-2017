nasa says the future space exploration rooted the past and time look again nuclear power the way the stars years after largely abandoning efforts apply atomic power space nasa last week announced nuclear systems initiative that said could jump start space exploration within decade tucked away the bush administration proposed budget for the agency million begin moving nasa into new nuclear age the early days the space program nasa looked into nuclear powered rockets possible means sending humans mars and other planets the agency tested some atomic rocket engines but abandoned the effort because missions arose use them the new program nuclear reactors would not directly produce thrust propel rockets the earlier program but would activated when far from earth supply power for other types engines the agency also developed electric generators powered radioactive materials that have been flown two dozen spacecraft including the pioneer and voyager outer planet probes and piloted apollo missions the moon the launching another probe with nuclear generator the cassini mission saturn drew protests from some environmental and antinuclear groups that worried that rocket explosion might spread radioactivity now only one these power units called radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs remain the civilian space inventory and officials say time reopen production lines the new program they say presents opportunity design and build new generators that are more efficient require less nuclear fuel and can used more varied spacecraft nasa proposing spend million over the next five years develop new types atomic powered generators supply electricity for spacecraft and also build nuclear electric rockets propel ships through space greater speed than possible with traditional rockets the nasa administrator sean keefe said nuclear power would help space explorers conquer the problems distance and time takes long time for spacecraft travel within the solar system said noting that would take more than decade for probe reach pluto using current technology the continued exploration the solar system and the space beyond being held back the limits conventional chemical rockets well existing spacecraft power supplies which mostly use solar powered cells keefe said officials said the nuclear program would conducted with the department energy which has the facilities and expertise construct nuclear power units earl wahlquist the energy department space and defense power systems division said the fuel most widely used rtgs plutonium longer produced the united states wahlquist said that his agency would use nasa funds buy the necessary plutonium from russia edward weiler head space science nasa said nuclear generators were necessary for outer planet missions where sunlight faint jupiter noted receives only percent the sunlight that reaches earth the galileo spacecraft which has been exploring jupiter and its moons powered two rtgs but new nuclear generators also could revolutionize studies near planets said the smart lander mission for mars which was scheduled for launching will delayed for two years convert from solar powered rover one run nuclear unit for roughly the same cost said the day solar powered mission could stretched days with nuclear power and the machine could range miles instead mile two looks for signs life for propulsion nuclear reactor could used heat source power new kinds engines like the electric ion drive successfully used the recent deep space mission that spacecraft used solar power run engine that continually pushed with very low thrust high speeds this approach used fuel times efficiently conventional chemical rockets which burn for few minutes and require the spacecraft coast for the rest its trip nuclear powered ion drive could sent craft pluto half the time existing rockets weiler said major priority the new program will safety said and developing technology that will virtually eliminate any risk the public something goes wrong like launching accident will design these new systems for worst case scenario weiler said they designed survive rocket blowing one going and then coming down and hitting the ground you can guarantee this your design then don want talk you nasa officials said the systems they envisioned would launched conventional rockets and not activated until safely space once operating they said neither electric power supplies nor reactors powering engines would leave residual radiation still there some opposition the initiative the global network against weapons and nuclear power space group based florida said remained opposed any nuclear systems space and speculated that any new technology developed might applied military uses weiler said nuclear energy was not only safe but necessary for further space exploration the limits current power and propulsion systems are now starting limit space science said are trying continue the exploration the solar system covered wagons said now time switch the steam engine and build railroads explore the solar system like railroads contributed the exploration and expansion this country
