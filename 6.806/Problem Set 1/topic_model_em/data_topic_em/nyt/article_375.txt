the government crash test dummy has given his hard living bachelor ways for family life automakers are grappling with new battery federal crash tests phased over the next decade those tests will require family dummies instead the only federally required test dummy since the 1970s foot pound model meant represent the average guy new tests will add dummy stand ins for small slender woman well for and year olds these dummies don sit straight like proper ladies and gentlemen but slouch more like real people one new test will position childlike dummy standing the front passenger seat another has the child dummy kneeling the front footwell front the passenger seat with its head right front the air bag position that one engineer called the worst case scenario the tests are part extensive modifications announced may federal motor vehicle safety standard the regulation that governs occupant protection inside automobiles the changes will phased from the tests aim part reduce the dangers that air bags pose small children who have been hurt and killed the force air bags deploying while preserving the bags utility the many situations where they can reduce injuries and the new version the standard known also aims enhance protection for both belted and unbelted car occupants that point contention because some automakers say that designing air bags that protect the unbelted may increase risks for those who heed the law and buckle companies like ford and general motors had already been working next generation technologies using dummies various sizes but the standard requires rethinking how seat belts and air bags interact with each other and with different sorts people inside car the most comprehensive regulation seen relative crashes said james khoury manager advanced safety engineering david clark safety engineer ford said you can imagine the number test considerations and evaluations small occupants belted unbelted middle sized occupants large occupants all the different crash scenarios added trying pull that whole picture together and balance the system design completely optimized for all these combinations tremendous challenge call holistic safety approach ford and are refining computerized safety brains that rapidly collect information from sensors all over the automobile some these sensors are already the road this week ford had press conference here demonstrate its newer technologies well some still being developed the ford taurus equipped with dual stage air bags are several vehicles like the chevrolet impala and number imported cars the bags inflate one two ways some crashes they are only half filled not used all depending how far forward the front seats are positioned and whether the seat belts are use how this done data collected from sensors and transmitted the restraints control module which bolted the floor under the front seats and the car safety brain calls its version the sensory and diagnostic module first line intelligence gathering crash severity sensor near the front bumper that tells the brain the force the crash the ford windstar minivan also comes with sensor that weighs the driver and front seat passenger and the jaguar sports car has four infrared sensors that indicate how someone leaning inside the car both and ford are also considering digital cameras that track person movements during the flickering course crash once the brain gathers this data can determine the seat belts are being used and how forcefully they should restrain the occupant also decides whether the air bags should deploy how much they should inflate and even what point the steering column will collapse ford and are also working technologies that would provide range inflation options for air bag beyond two settings well tethers that alter how far out the air bag will protrude the end the year have two million vehicles the road with the personal safety system said sue cischke vice president for environmental and safety engineering ford referring the company name for its newer safety technologies recent years ford has been troubled safety problems related its explorer sport utility and this week atlanta lawyer involved civil lawsuit raised questions about the fuel tank design mustangs built the mid ford vigorously defended the mustang design its safety press conference tuesday the company accentuated the positive ford was the first automaker participate government study vehicles that use advanced air bag technology most the first accidents the national highway traffic safety administration has studied involved the taurus and its sister model the mercury sable though few tests were done the honda accord and other vehicles the whole purpose was preserve the tremendous benefit air bags but reduce some the risks saw the first generation said rae tyson spokesman for the highway safety administration said the newer technologies appeared addressing some air bag problems but was too early the study draw definitive conclusions what seen far encouraging added
