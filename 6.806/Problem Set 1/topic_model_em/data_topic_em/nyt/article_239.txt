consumers helped stave off the recession and now they just might end take the blame downtimes linger rescue the nation from recession they must outmaneuver series doubts will the american reflex spend sufficiently outweigh layoff worries will their confidence have suffer still more shocks and could all the best spending intentions buried mountain credit card debt the key obstacle the extent indebtedness said max sawicky economist the economics policy institute that makes for some doubt about the strength consumption spending the nation economic woes officially recession that began march has already cost more than million full time jobs and torched corporate profits and approaching the month duration the average recession anticipation rebound intense optimists including most wall street economists and mainstream forecasters predict turnaround this year they see growth the third and fourth quarters annual rate about percent others talk about something more languid expect moderate recovery said maury harris chief economist ubs warburg recovery imminent but that still leaves plenty room for debate the precise speed and strength the turnaround how they consumers perform will strongly influence how quickly growth revives this year much wall street had begun buy the notion quick reversal and investors began shoving stocks skyward but harris and others cautioned the premature enthusiasm the sell off began yet mainstream expectations still call for bring recovery rebound and return growth the optimists cite low inflation which permits the federal reserve keep interest rates low they point the low price oil for cars and heating kind rebate for the economy that clips company costs and puts cash consumers pockets and consumers who have already done much keep this recession from being far worse business spending went from hesitant nearly nonexistent spending continued from the two thirds the economy that consists consumers that can again some people think hope sure seems there one else take the role washington waffles corporate earnings wane and there been convincing rally stock prices can the american impulse spend aided tax cuts make the difference that question divides economists there simply consensus about what factors will fuel recovery perhaps because the downturn itself like other entering typical recession consumer spending drops dramatically purchases cars houses and appliances are postponed under the threat reality layoffs but when things improve spending booms pent demand bursts not this time said mark vitner economist for wachovia securities this recession has been very odd from the get the current recession did not start with higher prices and interest rates triggered consumer overspending instead business blew out its checkbooks pouring money into new equipment new plants and huge retail developments fueled spectacular stock prices and floods venture capital companies reached for the stars expanding far beyond demand for what they sold many internet companies fell from grace then came manufacturing the core the economy collapse that continues march the economy was recession destiny sealed sept all year long the federal reserve campaigned for more spending eleven times the fed cut short term interest rates down year lows make borrowing cheaper unfortunately for many companies new investment remains stalled they just added too much capacity during the boom now manufacturing plants are producing percent rate capacity clear sign that companies don see demand catching yet which why consumers figure into positive projections after all they have already done much while company investment plunged the economy rose the updraft consumer spending sales homes stayed strong refinancing mortgages poured hundreds billions dollars into the economy and thanks zero interest financing vehicle sales hit records the fall most recessions end when the pent demand consumers unleashed spending spree this time consumers get credit for keeping the economy out recession for months and while the recession technically dated from march was the sept shock consumers and their abrupt spending halt that pitched the economy into the ditch and even then consumer spending has kept the downturn relatively mild but that means housing and vehicle sales are already strong they cannot expected explode said gary tapp quantitative analyst for suntrust robinson humphrey the slingshot rebound from consumers that you usually get after recession probably will not happen this time still consumers count lot consumers could surprise the experts and brighten the picture they could turn sour and keep any recovery anemic worse yet the most recent numbers are hopeful the monthly university michigan consumer confidence survey came month high most the increase came the strength consumer expectations that the economy will stronger within few months there are reasons hope for the best tapp said relatively low mortgage rates might prop the housing and construction industries and indicators last week seemed show hope for strength and the huge tax cut passed last spring could serve throw roughly billion into the hands consumers this year this year lowered tax brackets seem nearly minuscule the average household will benefit only every two weeks yet that paltry sum will multiplied more than million times and partly because the amounts individually are small that money will not likely saved only spent harris said and that what the economy needs moreover about billion will mailed annual tax refunds the next few months that money too likely spent and will act stimulus said but skeptics scoff rising unemployment one strike against consumer spending kind feedback loop joblessness saps consumer willingness spend which hurts corporate profits which can mean more layoffs unemployment after the last recession peaked june more than year after the downturn ended march the current jobless rate currently percent will likely crest over percent economists have said rajeev dhawan director the georgia state university economic forecasting center has predicted the rate will crest the autumn about percent consumers also sometimes get carried along with the stock market spending more when they feel wealthier and less when the market down but not everyone subject the wealth effect layoffs what does affect nearly all americans employed and otherwise debt the ratio debt payments disposable income has climbed percent the highest has been since the mid 1980s tapp said that bad but not fatal said are looking for fairly weak recovery and that one the factors consumer debt fairly high but not horribly alarming among those who think alarming are economists the levy economics institute bard college new york the
