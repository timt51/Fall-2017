two rival biotechnology companies announced this week that they had cloned pigs that were missing specific gene feat that experts say helps pave the way transplanting pig organs into people without causing immune rejection with human organs short supply companies have been racing develop called knockout pigs which gene that prompts rejection has been removed knocked out although pigs have been cloned before until now scientists have been able only add genes not take them away thursday researchers the university missouri columbia collaboration with immerge biotherapeutics biotechnology firm based charlestown mass announced that they had created four cloned miniature pigs each lacking one two copies the crucial gene the piglets all female and apparently healthy were born september and october wednesday ppl therapeutics the scottish company that helped create dolly the cloned sheep said had cloned five pigs that lack one copy the gene the animals were born christmas day ppl therapeutics branch blacksburg and the company has named them noel angel star joy and mary the missouri pigs have numbers experts say the animals represent important milestone the field animal human transplants known xenotransplantation but significant hurdles remain before scientists will ready test pig organs people first the researchers must breed animals that lack both copies the gene second transplant experts expect face other problems involving immune rejection although less daunting ones third critics warn that the pig organs could introduce deadly viruses into the recipients this very important step what has been long pathway said david sachs director the transplantation biology research center massachusetts general hospital who collaborates with immerge biotherapeutics but did not work this experiment but are not there yet with more than americans waiting receive human organs and demand far exceeding supply scientists have long looked animals the answer the shortage this why cloning was developed said david ayares chief operating officer ppl therapeutics branch xenotransplantation the holy grail the cloning field and the unmet clinical need that can met here huge but immune rejection has been huge barrier and the field xenotransplantation littered with failures among them the celebrated baby fae case which baby died after receiving baboon heart recent years scientists have focused pigs because they are readily available and easily bred but pigs carry gene that not present humans the gene triggers production enzyme called galactosyltransferase which makes sugar that humans recognize foreign the human immune system kills the pig organs almost immediately the idea behind the recent cloning experiments was create supply identical animals that lack the problematic gene but said randall prather the reproductive biologist from the university missouri who led the immerge biotherapeutics research until this time haven been able remove gene have only been able add genes clone the animals company scientists first developed line cells from pig fetus said julia greenstein immerge biotherapeutics chief executive scientists then took dna that was specifically designed disrupt the gene that results the production the sugar molecule and introduced the dna into the fetal cells the researchers then identified cells that had taken the dna and put the correct place those cells were frozen and shipped prather missouri inserted them into pig embryos and transferred the embryos into surrogate mothers who gave birth the four cloned piglets the company chose miniature pigs prather said because they will weigh only pounds when grown and are therefore better match for humans than full size swine which can top pounds the results his experiment are reported the current issue the journal science immerge biotherapeutics was formed joint venture novartis pharma and biotransplant inc ayares ppl therapeutics said his company pigs will weigh pounds when mature the ppl therapeutics research announced wednesday the eve the release prather study has not yet been published academic journal and drew criticism result leading opponent xenotransplantation alix fano director the campaign for responsible transplantation new york based advocacy group described the ppl announcement publicity stunt designed attract investors attract investors but not publicity stunt said ayares who added that was the company policy announce the results experiments before they were published said the company was looking for investment partner and was trying raise million venture capital spin off its american branch into separate company xenotransplant research has generated intense controversy much that prather would not reveal the whereabouts his four miniature pigs because security said animal rights activists oppose the work and critics say not safe because the threat viruses one virus that has been especially worrisome scientists called perv porcine endogenous retrovirus immerge biotherapeutics says its pigs not carry the virus but fano said she was not convinced xenotransplantation fraught with danger she said this could trigger epidemic exposing the public large viruses known and unknown cloning itself also controversial and the results prather experiments are likely fuel the debate over the safety human cloning get the four miniature piglets prather said and his team transplanted about genetically modified embryos into surrogates seven piglets were born but two died shortly after delivery respiratory distress said the third died days old during routine blood collection procedure autopsy that animal showed dilated right ventricle the heart and thickening the heart wall prather said both prather and greenstein said the next step was for the company breed pigs that have both genes removed and then work other problems involving immune rejection down the road before will have payoffs prather said but the payoffs are now sight
