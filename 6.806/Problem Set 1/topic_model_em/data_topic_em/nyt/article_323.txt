racial and ethnic tensions rarely become public events the predominantly white texas amp campus some people believe the student newspaper doing its best change that since last summer the battalion has published editorial cartoons that have offended jewish catholic and muslim students the issue became public controversy earlier this month when black students demanded apology for cartoon drawn with racially offensive caricatures the cartoons have not only reinforced the school image being inhospitable minorities critics say but also fueled the impression that the administration reluctant deal with thorny student problems the critics say the administration handling the editorial cartoon controversy reminiscent the tunnel vision and cultural bias blamed for ignoring warning signs that could have prevented the bonfire tragedy that killed students this direct parallel the tunnel vision bonfire said the rev kyle walker director christian ministry that serves amp students and president the campus ministry association texas amp university umbrella group for campus ministers various faiths the aggie family becoming more and more divided walker said not only have bonfire but the color our skin now dividing amp president ray bowen who led the university through the harrowing bonfire aftermath and plans step down june strongly disagreed with the analogy said that student newspapers public universities have strong first amendment protections and that and other administrators did everything possible talking the student journalists and publicly denouncing one the editorials had history regrettably the last several months which the battalion seemingly gravitating anything that could create controversy bowen said part dealing with young people sometimes they inspire you and sometimes they disappoint you the important thing for the institution have consistent response the controversial cartoons were all drawn the same student chad mallam but most students not know his identity because uses pen name the uncartoonist being anonymous kind like the hoods the kkk said walker who did not know mallam was the cartoonist gives the same protection the person expressing the opinion july mallam published cartoon the day depicting two students carrying bibles staring the opening oversized bottle booze the almost empty bottle big that the students could easily sit inside sports sign saying catholic club meeting one the students asks the other you think this the right place week later the battalion published cartoon showing jewish student yarmulke pondering sign that

lips features frequently used racist caricatures the overweight woman with her curlers apron and spatula says her son you ain careful you gonna end doing airport security although bowen said all can advise the students and react consistently concerns some the offended students say the administration lack consistency part the problem scathing letter published the battalion bowen deplored the cartoon that caricatured blacks and said casts doubt whether are truly welcoming place for all people but the administration never publicly spoke out against the other cartoons was pretty much slap the face said brette peyton senior from paso who president amp hillel organization for jewish students caused stir about being the battalion the summer but nothing was said which happens lot with jewish issues and other minority groups being ignored you feel like you don really matter but could problem when african americans are offended bowen said did not know about the summer cartoons until was asked about them reporter said malon southerland amp vice president for student affairs handled the matter speaking the student journalists the group ministers sent the battalion letter september

cartoons perpetuate stereotype texas amp university narrow minded and bigoted said the letter which requested public retraction and apology copy was forwarded southerland southerland said met with the ministers the fall and thought closure had been reached the issue when explained that the administration could nothing other than talk the student journalists said the ministers never told him they wanted more done southerland said met with the student editor his home the fall were giving the administration the chance respond privately without answering media questions walker said very sorry did that mallam senior from dallas studying architecture denied uses pen name shield himself from attack but mariano castillo houston senior who took over editor the battalion this month has consistently refused divulge mallam name because said did not want the cartoonist hassled mallam said proposed using pen name when became cartoonist last year because wanted his drawings speak for themselves said did not want anyone attach political socioeconomic beliefs his name declined telephone interview say white what his religion saying those were pointless questions said did not intend any his cartoons

the cartoon might offensive jews mallam wrote apology signed the uncartoonist the day after that cartoon was published saying his editor jeff kemp asked him write the letter said did not meet with any university officials over that any other cartoon but thinks kemp may have met with officials peyton said she and many other students met with kemp who could not reached for comment she said she considered the apology disingenuous because never acknowledged that the paper made mistake saying only that the cartoon was not meant offend peyton said many the jewish students campus were also offended last spring when the corps cadets chaplain position held student invoked jesus christ during muster ceremony even though the jewish students were assured such mention would not happen southerland said the student chaplain promised would not invoke jesus christ but did anyway said sent strong letter the corps saying this was inappropriate public university functions and the new
