the bush administration decision call off the quest for mile per gallon car favor research fuel cell powered vehicles will delay the nation freedom from foreign oil for years fans and critics the move agreed wednesday the fans however say that although might years before drivers zip around cars that drip only water from the tail pipe the wait will worth critics doubt the administration strategy shift many said wednesday shortsighted blunder that gives the best thing going and will allow detroit keep churning out gas guzzlers even fuel cell technology the future they say what about the next years think everyone agrees fuel cells are the next fuel technology said jason mark who directs the clean vehicle program for the union concerned scientists environment oriented advocacy group that claims members but the short term need strategy increase fuel economy energy secretary spencer abraham said wednesday that the administration would end clinton era program develop affordable high mileage car something the nation has spent billion since instead said the country should invest unknown amount partnership with the auto industry develop vehicles powered fuel cells which squeeze electricity from hydrogen and leave only water byproduct announced the freedom car cooperative auto research program detroit automotive show representatives the auto industry and companies working develop fuel cell technology said the administration wisely choosing invest technology that could eliminate the nation reliance oil instead simply tinkering with today gas powered cars make them run more efficiently certainly the right thing see and how can use hydrogen source energy said philip gott automotive consultant for dri wefa international consulting firm the only fuel that can burned with zero impact but make competitive and reasonable cost lot work has done said you focus your efforts intermediate technology you postponing the day the ultimate solution will come critics including leading environmental groups called for continuing the clinton program for raising minimum fuel efficiency standards for trucks vans and suvs and for improving hybrid and battery powered vehicles the better way solve our energy needs raise fuel economy standards miles per gallon said alan madison sierra club spokesman make cars and light trucks farther gallon gas will save far more oil than import from the persian gulf could ever find the arctic national wildlife refuge and more importantly would saving drivers money the gas pump the senate expected debate raising fuel efficiency standards for small trucks vans and suvs next month the freedom car program will focus developing the technology mass produce affordable hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicles and the hydrogen supply infrastructure support them according energy department officials some observers the auto industry including andrew frank mechanical engineering professor the university california davis are skeptical that anything will ever come there continuous ploy the car companies create vehicle that just beyond the reach technology said frank researcher and proponent hybrid vehicles which have both gasoline engine and electric motor they say just leave alone and make great cars and the administration has fallen for just they did with the electric car frank predicted automakers eventually will declare the hydrogen powered vehicle impractical they stop and they say because costs too much produce and isn competitive with the gas powered car said guarantee frank would like automakers and the government put their money and minds into hybrid vehicle technology says japanese and european car manufacturers are doing even the automakers said they were going start building and selling high tech hybrids would three four years before they would start coming out the market said fuel cell cars are way behind that mark the union concerned scientists refuses choose sides the debate both sides says are right his organization like many environmental groups favors increasing the federal minimum fuel efficiency standards for trucks and sport utility vehicles from mpg mpg the auto industry already has the know how achieve that mark says with improvements engines transmission and aerodynamics government support for fuel cells research vital said the social benefits fuel cells are too great ignore would love see this program move forward tandem with increased mileage standards
