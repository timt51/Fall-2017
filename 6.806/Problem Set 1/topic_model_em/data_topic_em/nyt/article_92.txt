the car the future according general motors will have its engine encased the floor and need gasoline will also have body and interior that can replaced moods change electronically connected components instead mechanical parts and power source that can serve your home from the driveway mockup the car display here this week the north american international auto show this concept vehicle called the autonomy has few moving parts other than the wheels and part continuing research into cars powered fuel cells source that holds the promise emitting only water and heat relying hydrogen instead gas most automakers including are putting greater emphasis ways make fuel cells fit into conventional cars and trucks experimental pickup truck shown august had fuel cell that took bit more than third its bed but adapting cars will costly think the end the decade see hundreds thousands fuel cells the road said lawrence burns vice president for research and development whatever the timetable the emphasis shared the bush administration which chose the auto show the occasion offer fuel economy plan focusing fuel cell development aside from its effort squeeze fuel cells into conventional cars trucks and buses had separate team engineers and designers envision vehicle unfettered the constraints the automobile which for century has been designed around internal combustion engine and mechanical parts the result vehicle that comes two parts the first what engineers call the skateboard six inch thick platform encasing the engine and the car computer system the body including the seats and interior will perch the platform with features like braking steering and acceleration controlled digitally electrical impulses recent demonstration engineers showed mockup the skateboard which was almost feet long and shaped like flattened carafe with goodyear tires and several thin parallel heating vents curving each side the second part the body looked like sci version formula one racecar envisions that the skateboard will last about years with the body popped off and replaced with version customized the owner tastes far more often this like blank canvas and you can paint whatever you want top said adrian chernoff program architect the project adding that the body could switched the time takes for oil change burns said that hoped produce working prototype the autonomy the end the year but with inch thick skateboard fit hydrogen tanks large enough for trip miles such vehicle would drastically alter automobile assembly raising questions like who would make the bottom and who would make the top for years automakers have been ceding more and more the manufacturing end auto suppliers course concept cars often resemble era vision the future more than the actual future firebird concepts the paid homage booming airline industry with turbine engines and tail fins that made seem the cars were made from spare parts fighter jets other concepts featured cool gizmos that never made into production like the rear view camera mounted the back the vision the buick centurion for the fuel cell the major automakers tout silver bullet answer many the problems that now cause their industry butt heads with environmental groups their ideal form fuel cells would replace gasoline with hydrogen and emit only water and heat the cells strip electrons from hydrogen atoms and use them electrical current then reform the hydrogen atoms combining them with oxygen form water vapor the technology could principle useful supplying power homes and industry powering vehicles far however the fuel cell has mainly served only argument against regulatory pressure make short term improvements fuel economy senate commerce committee hearing december vice president for product development thomas davis cited fuel cell research reason that existing fuel economy standards should not raised the standards have not significantly changed for more than decade and fuel economy gains have been reversed recent years sales trucks have overtaken sales cars address the issue the clinton administration emphasized development high mileage gasoline fueled vehicles goal which the big three automakers have been spending billion year rather take those dollars and move solutions like the fuel cell faster burns said interview that essence the vision the bush administration has now
