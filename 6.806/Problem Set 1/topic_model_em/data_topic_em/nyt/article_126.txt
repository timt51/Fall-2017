after spending years and billion studies the energy department said thursday that would recommend that yucca mountain barren volcanic structure about miles from las vegas used bury thousands tons highly radioactive nuclear waste from power plants and nuclear weapons factories the department has been trying for decades find place dispose the waste piling its bomb factories and civilian power plants and thursday decision only one step tortuous process with outcome that still uncertain but the first time that the department has said publicly that can make scientific case that the waste can secured yucca mountain the project faces substantial technical legal and political challenges and could derailed either house congress the courts engineering problems since congress chose the site prime candidate for the burial wastes nevada officials and environmental groups have questioned the ability engineers reliably predict that will not leak significantly for years government rules require the energy secretary spencer abraham added twist the debate thursday saying should consolidate the nuclear wastes enhance protection against terrorist attacks moving them one underground location that far from population centers the project expected cost more than billion president bush approves and other problems block preparation the earliest that waste could stored the mountain officials said but the suitability the site still far from clear some scientists and faces the intense opposition the nevada congressional delegation including harry reid the deputy majority leader simple majority either house could block the project although reid and john ensign the republican senator from nevada said that would difficult reid called the recommendation audacious saying scientific work not complete pointed out that the general accounting office last month said there were issues still studied before the energy department would ready apply the nuclear regulatory commission for license open repository they should just cool till they ready reid said but abraham said thursday that believed that the science behind this project sound and that the site technically suitable for this purpose but the senate majority leader tom daschle said recommendation now would unfortunate and premature ensign who has also vowed fight the project said that the energy department seemed hell bent making yucca mountain the repository matter what scientific studies showed putting the waste nevada has one advantage for the other states means the hot potato went somewhere else and there pressure from some state governments solve the problem operating power reactors around the country are running out storage space spending money extend their storage capacity while the nuclear industry not near building new reactors many plant owners are seeking year extensions their year operating permits john sununu the former white house chief staff and former governor new hampshire which was once considered for burial site and geraldine ferraro the former congresswoman from new york said joint statement that abraham decision was decisive step forward towards meeting our generation responsibility for the stewardship used nuclear fuel and defense waste sununu and ferraro are members committee assembled the chamber commerce push for the opening the yucca site abraham announcement took the form day advance notice the governor nevada required under the nuclear waste law that the department will recommend the site the president disposal nuclear waste has been festering problem for the civilian power industry for years but has drawn more attention since the sept terrorist attacks most the spent fuel stored giant steel lined pools which were intended hold only few years their reactor output but now have decades fuel they are built withstand earthquake tornado and other threats but they were drained terrorist attack experts say that they could burn and spread vast amounts radiation but the decades long argument over what with nuclear waste even the terrorist argument cuts both ways depending who providing the analysis some opponents nuclear power say that the waste not safe where power plants around the country but would even more risk trucks and trains route nevada the mayor las vegas oscar goodman said would oppose the use yucca rallying the mayors cities along the transportation routes said that there were cities with populations least those routes and million people living within half mile the routes the federal effort find place put wastes began the 1960s congress promised have repository open january and the energy department signed contracts with the reactor owners take their wastes beginning that time exchange for payment tenth cent per kilowatt hour generated nuclear power plants since then the government has collected about billion but will least before yucca could open even remains the chosen site the utilities are suing for breach contract often backed their state regulators who say ratepayers have paid for disposal but received nothing return some opponents say that driving hard yucca mountain the department may have taken years long detour down blind alley the institute for environment and energy research arjun makhijani nuclear scientist who specializes studying the energy department said that favored repository but that the chemical conditions yucca mountain were certain cause corrosion the containers and the spread radioactive materials scientists agree that the most likely way that the materials would spread leaking into the water that flows down inside the mountain and then moves underground beneath the desert fact the energy department has learned more about the characteristics the rock has placed more reliance the packaging plans develop for the waste and less the rock itself this has led opponents assert that the project longer the law requires geologic repository but man made one another problem that the department recently belatedly concluded that law firm winston amp strawn that has done much the groundwork for preparing application license the yucca site had conflict interest because was also lobbyist for the nuclear industry the time the choice survives the congress the energy department will have submit application for license the nuclear regulatory commission which must hold hearings and decide whether yucca can contain the wastes for years under rules written last year the environmental protection agency
