joe garofoli san francisco chronicle they hyped long term savior the earth atmosphere technological godsend that will create pollution free cars and liberate americans from importing petroleum from unstable countries way down the road some predict this energy source could become compact that family could power its home hooking car sitting the driveway yet for now the commercialization fuel cell engines remains hydrogen filled dream possible only with major government subsidies pay for expensive new energy infrastructure some wonder fuel cell technology which mixes hydrogen and oxygen generate pollution free electricity can ever mass produced vehicle still its potential enchanting that has inspired automakers oil companies and the federal government invest billions into engine that percent more efficient than the gasoline powered internal combustion model hoping replace california these sometimes competing players have agreed share their research west sacramento demonstration project the year old california fuel cell partnership unites energy providers automakers and government agencies collaborative quest for the magic fuel cell bullet although dozens fuel cell vehicles are being road tested california requires that percent all model year passenger vehicles qualify zero emission nearly nonpolluting two percent those vehicles roughly cars must fuel cell battery powered electric other zero emission rides there not going fuel cell cars out there next year because they too expensive build now said joe irvin spokesman for the california fuel cell partnership the automakers will find other ways meet those goals fact automakers don expect decent selection fuel cell powered vehicles showrooms for least years the end experts expect owners large fleets such delivery firms and utilities begin using fuel cell vehicles think mass market commercialization will happen sooner than said toyota managing director hiroyuki watanabe privately others worry that all the rosy futurism about fuel cells sounds eerily familiar many the same predictions were made about battery powered electric vehicles and not many those rolled into driveways but fuel cell cars don need recharged chore that helped sink the battery powered electrics fuel cell cars would refueled with either liquid gaseous form hydrogen instead automakers have virtually stopped making the electrics for the mass market because they were too expensive build didn have much range and consumers weren buying them their place hybrid cars which combine gasoline engine and electric motor have emerged low emission alternative until fuel cell technology ready for the mass market yet the comparison nagged experts recent electric vehicle association the americas conference sacramento what makes the hype surrounding fuel cells any different from the predictions about electric cars may not that different said john wallace executive director ford motor electric powered cars and fuel cell proponent not done deal yet there nothing inevitable about fuel cells wallace wasn being pessimistic merely realistic experts are still trying get consensus how fuel the vehicles although hydrogen the most abundant element the universe scientists are trying determine the best and safest way capture and store one option pump gaseous form the element directly into the vehicle from pumping station this would allow the vehicle truly emission free because other than water there would waste products created while hydrogen converted into electricity board the next problem how supply hydrogen this point researchers haven figured out how transform the gasoline pumps the corner chevron into hydrogen refueling stations hydrogen refueling stations would cost about each for the needed satisfy the first phase commercialization california according recent study for the independent california fuel cell partnership some experts say better option create hydrogen board extracting from either methanol ethanol sulfur free gasoline known clean hydrocarbon fuel the upside this technology that would cost about modify medium size gas station into one that could deliver these fuels according the fuel cell partnership consultant their own automakers are testing vehicles that use methanol petroleum ethanol and other mixtures produce hydrogen the downside that this type fuel would require cars have onboard reformer transform the fuel into hydrogen which may add premium each car although that cost will decrease the technology improves fuel cells are going happen then lot critical decisions must made california over the next few years these cars are going come the showrooms said roland hwang senior policy analyst with the natural resources defense council october the partnership decided use hydrogen created from natural gas the first fuel source tested its demonstration vehicles the partnership plans erect four hydrogen refueling stations around the state the end honda has already built solar powered hydrogen filling station its torrance los angeles county campus slowly but surely progress being made the groundbreaking collaborative effort the fuel cell partnership its roster includes oil companies such british petroleum and air resources board officials plans demonstrate and test fuel cell vehicles yet automakers say they need government subsidies and tax incentives help commercialize fuel cell engines society benefits from technology then society has ready help support said ford wallace the public sector needs support research that too financially risky for private industry develop their own tom gross deputy assistant secretary with the energy department acknowledges the need gross hopes next year budget will contain substantial increase over the million that his department spent fuel cell research this year gross said the terrorist attacks sept made the search for alternative fuels more intense not everybody going full throttle the drive toward commercialization february general motors sued the california air resources board over rules that require automakers produce pollution free cars the automaker said couldn meet the requirement without producing dangerously small battery powered cars moves like that cause some industry observers wonder fuel cells are driving down the same dead end road battery powered electric cars did this different from electric cars said kateri callahan executive director the electric vehicle association the americas she witnessed the rise and plateau interest electric vehicles this time there lot more excitement from the automakers corporate level with fuel cells callahan said plus this time the oil companies are involved before they didn want anything with electric cars
