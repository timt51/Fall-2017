readers often ask about the south korean cars that have been coming american since hyundai introduced its first model the excel are they any good the main question and have say that the answer that has changed for the good over the past decade today three south korean automakers have dealer networks hyundai kia and daewoo and among them they sell everything from econoboxes sport utilities minivan and near luxury midsize sedans the short answer that for the most part the korean autos get here are pretty good they aren quite japanese standards but they are least good not better than their and european built direct competitors when the korean cars began arrive here they were cheap knockoffs japanese cars way below japanese standards but eagerly accepted consumers who initially thought that they would good japanese cars because they came from that side the globe those first ones from hyundai gave the company black eye that still trying recover from but the south koreans credit they have significantly improved their vehicles point where they can compete effectively against japanese and european competitors make for any deficiencies the vehicles might have quality and durability they generally are offered bargain prices comparison japanese and even cars that certainly the case with the all new kia sedona minivan kia which entered the market with two vehicles the sportage compact sport utility and the sephia compact sedan this past fall became the first the south korean carmakers introduce minivan the united states because financial problems mostly involving its parent company kia motors was sold hyundai but will remain separate company for now with its separate sales and marketing arm the sedona was already the works when hyundai bought kia and development the vehicle was allowed continue even though hyundai still has minivan its lineup these very well equipped minivans start just for the base model and for the uplevel version with fully equipped topping out about comparison chevrolet venture ranges from about the honda odyssey from and the industry leading dodge caravan from just under more than found the kia quite comparable japanese models such the odyssey and mazda mpv but not quite the caliber the best japanese minivan the toyota sienna yet for the price the sedona quite bargain inch for inch the fit finish and attention detail clearly cut above the dodge and chrysler minivans but the overall range options and features somewhat limited when compared with the dodge chrysler vans and those from ford and general motors for one thing kia doesn offer electric sliding doors feature pioneered general motors the early 90s the oldsmobile silhouette and later copied chrysler and others its credit though the sedona has sliding doors both sides the rear passenger compartment that almost close themselves just release the door from its catch and let and weighted slides forward and latches with help long the vehicle level ground pointing downhill maybe that better than having electric door that can catch little fingers even with safety mechanisms that are supposed prevent that outside the sedona looks like just about every other minivan the market and particularly similar the ford windstar and toyota sienna that surprise the koreans have had qualms about copying others designs for their cars and learned the 90s that really doesn pay get truly creative with minivan design anyway called dustbuster minivans the early 90s the chevy lumina apv previous generation silhouette and pontiac trans sport were generally eschewed consumers because their cutting edge design inside the kia quite well appointed least the version the dash and instrument panel are trimmed wood grain something that would come only more expensive version the competing minivans controls are easy reach and simple operate and the gauges are big round analog style instruments that are easy read even low light our car came with two quite comfy front bucket seats two captains chairs the middle row and bench seat the rear for total seven seating positions even with the rear seat place there was decent sized cargo area the rear cubic feet thanks the sedona long wheelbase inches for the base caravan under the hood quite adequate liter horsepower engine which has more horsepower than the caravan and more than the venture the
