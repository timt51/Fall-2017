early saturday the the white house expected announce the choice yucca mountain miles northwest las vegas the place safely bury decades accumulated nuclear waste some years later all goes well the government will figure out just how between though congress the courts and the nuclear regulatory commission will all debate whether the project should forward the problem for all three not much risk confidence thursday nevada governor kenny guinn and both its senators met with president bush for minutes and made last minute plea for him not forward the recommendation congress but some officials said they expected bush soon formally receives the energy department recommendation the risk from radioactive material already here was created with the waste that results from nuclear reactors the draft environmental impact statement predicts burying yucca would kill several people through cancer that may take decades develop from low radiation doses and that will indistinguishable from other fatal cancers leaving the fuel where generally the reactors will the same you dealing with few latent cancer fatalities thousands years any case said lake barrett the acting director the office civilian radioactive waste management the estimate hypothetical based the assumption scientifically unproven that every dose radiation matter how small raises the risk cancer still using that assumption backers yucca will seek prove that offers the safest way isolate the waste for the years required law their ability demonstrate that this handicapped poor track record and high risk strategy the track record consists the energy department previous estimates how long takes radioactive materials move through the dirt eventually containers will give way and the steady drip rainwater will carry traces the radioactive material deep underground where they will reach the water table and flow beyond the site the energy department argues that yucca dry and that the soil does not conduct radioactive isotopes well but the energy department and its predecessor agencies the atomic energy commission and the manhattan project made the same arguments about the soils the hanford nuclear reservation washington state where they dumped billions gallons contaminated water into open trenches the soil would bind with the radioactive materials like merlot white tablecloth they said now the radioactive material moving toward the columbia river yucca poses lower risk than hanford one way but planners not describe explicitly the columbia vital the pacific northwest but water from yucca feeds much smaller area there are homes and farms below the mountain but leaks what yucca will eventually poison death valley still the department strategy has risks because trying build while still solving problems the common approach what nuclear engineers call first akind projects the strategy stretches back the manhattan project where produced weapon time for test over hiroshima but has also led some horrifying dead ends for example the savannah river site nuclear weapons plant near aiken the department spent more than billion build factory that takes liquid radioactive wastes from aging tanks and turns them into solid mixing them with glass which makes disposal possibly yucca easier when built the plant had not figured out how get the wastes out the tanks the plan was put chemical into the tanks that would make the most radioactive materials sink they could pumped the solidification plant but the tanks that chemical was converted explosive gas the department has spent over years and about million trying solve the problem meanwhile much the waste stays the tanks another problem left for last how move the waste yucca the president new budget allocates million for studying that question from million this year but clearly political weak spot for yucca advocates the nuclear power industry used build reactors the way the department wants build yucca applying for license and beginning construction before completing the designs the industry concluded that was key reason for huge cost overruns and executives swore that they ever got build another plant they would get approval for completed design before the first shovel dirt was turned ten years ago the energy department too eschewed the overlapping strategy leo duffy then charge environmental management the department argued that technical questions had solved front because there technical tooth fairy that going come along and solve these problems now however the project being hurried with officials hoping stick plan accept waste and the early 1980s the department signed contracts with the nuclear utilities promising take their wastes beginning january exchange for payment tenth cent per kilowatt hour from reactors now there another reason strive for completion judge has found that the utilities can sue for damages whatever the technical arguments barrett pointed out legal imperative took their money said
