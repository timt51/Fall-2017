ford soon will roll out the second generation its once best selling full size sport utility the expedition the new model represents more than superficial makeover all new from the ground with improvements that ford hopes will allow the vehicle overtake the segment leading chevrolet tahoe and regain its former status ford has tough row hoe for chevy sold tahoes while ford sold just the expedition that was percent decline for the expedition and percent increase for the tahoe but those figures are bit misleading because dominates the full size suv segment much more significantly than that when sales the chevy suburban gmc yukon and yukon and cadillac escalade are added the tahoe sales the totals show that sold full size sport utilities compared with for the expedition and lincoln navigator combined the navigator luxury version the expedition and tallied just sales for the year fraction the sales the escalade the fanciest version the tahoe even when ford was claiming dominance the segment was comparing sales the expedition only against those the tahoe which ford contends the closest direct competitor but those figures didn include the escalade the yukon gmc version the tahoe the suburban which the vehicle that ford originally targeted with the introduction the expedition the tahoe suburban escalade yukon and yukon which gmc new name for its former suburban model all are essentially the same vehicle the suburban and yukon are just longer versions the tahoe and yukon adding some cargo space behind the third seat other than that there real difference still the expedition will very credible entry the segment and should please not only current expedition owners looking move into something newer but also some other consumers considering move into full size suvs roomier though wheelbase remains the same about inches wider than before and the floor nine inches lower make easier get and out and increase interior space styling similar that the new explorer introduced last year side side the vehicles look junior and senior size versions the same truck among the most significant new features are the independent rear suspension which allows for softer more

driver intent provide full braking power emergency reducing real world braking distance percent more ford says and the new advancetrac electronic stability enhancement system monitors traction all wheels and automatically maintains stability while cornering slippery surfaces deference the tire problems ford experienced with the previous generation explorer there are tire pressure monitors built into all four tires alert the driver the pressures are too low too high the same feature including the new explorer partially because the tragic rollover accidents explorers with firestone tires are believed have been caused part underinflation the tires ford says the new expedition chassis percent stiffer than before fuel economy has been improved the four wheel drive models with the liter engine miles per gallon city highway from the current city highway the liter engine now has cast iron block for longer life the smaller liter still comes with aluminum block the new expedition scheduled begin arriving dealerships early spring prices have been announced yet but expect them competitive with the tahoe and yukon well the toyota sequoia which the other suv this segment ford
