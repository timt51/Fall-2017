dad cuba gooding enfolds james coburn bear hug and the two men share the first many laughs the two oscar winners haven seen each other since filming wrapped year ago disney snow dogs which opens friday the paternal reference their roles the film which gooding plays miami dentist ted brooks who inherits dog sledding team and heads alaska search his identity there encounters thunder jack coburn racer who disdains city slickers and who turns out ted father snow dogs also stars nichelle nichols sisqo graham greene and whole parcel siberian huskies the two have reunited talk about the film and their casual bantering gooding hotel suite any indication the year old gooding and the year old coburn have missed each other company the two best supporting actor winners gooding for jerry maguire and coburn for affliction trade quips they lounge side side sofa coburn finally suggests that spot chopin would order and off the two the hotel bar before they departed however got question two about acting filming blizzards and course those dogs any merit fields warning against acting with kids animals coburn was more accurate about kids they were such beautiful animals didn have any problems with them did gooding nope nope they were doll they were professional they were well trained coburn and they did everything required them without whimper generally with big bark and whoom let they love run man they were beautiful gooding only gripe was when would finally get scene right then they have maybe another take for dog maybe not hitting his mark that kind stuff dogs get used the repetitiveness and after awhile they get bored and start doing their own thing but brian levant the director helped because shot quick soon got the master shot above the dogs heads and the close ups real quick coburn they bark and holler and soon someone said phew was nothing but the snow and the sled was great feeling gooding the back that sled coburn was great fun people asked wasn hard wasn hard all you need hang you can understand how people get hung doing gooding got little cold times like with the blizzards and coburn was trouper you were trouper with that stuff because was like there way getting the back that sled and got take after take doing coburn got nosebleed one night had the blizzard and couldn finish scene started producer jordan kerner got panicky thought was really falling pieces said jordan going five minutes mon let get the scene and insisted going down miles the doctor she said was just little nose bleed there doesn seem anything there and said that what told you jordan blew the whole expletive night because this nose bleed and your anxiety laughs gooding when you outside the cold and something below zero the moisture your nostrils the hair freezes feels like you breathing rocks the weirdest thing some cold nights there but just beautiful rocks your nose mark missing bow wows sounds like blast what attracted you two snow dogs begin with coburn attracted because was playing son and thought that would interesting thing laughs the script fascinated and doing disney film you have learn whole new kind form work within because there are parameters you can beyond like swearing cussing the actions have within certain form that was kind challenge for was for you gooding absolutely also have new kids ages and there whole part life now when home not working film over weekends want try bond with them quickly possible like many parents all across america take kids family movie the problem with that the movie either too geared toward kids where boring too adult oriented and kids are bored with this script was such nice balance there the dogs and everything and the action the keaton esque physical comedy riding the dogsled but the same time the relationship the dynamics james coburn and character didn play big racial thing was just coburn finding father gooding finding father and thought that was the smartest thing had read because the face america changing man coburn must say had great time working together was really joy gooding also close these characters very sweet man even though plays really hard the beginning the movie was character with some the stuff were doing not couldn differentiate because was always open done other films with actors who have played these dark roles and they have stay character all day and that how they get that place that wonderful but hard tell had such good time the character and real life coburn you don have take that with you learned long time ago where acting acting and real life real life sometime crosses over but you can the same person doing both but carry that expletive around with you man just sick you don have that gooding like stress same thing you doing some brooding character and you feel like you see these great dark performances you meet the guy and still character and you think man you got let laughs you need bottle wine something coburn affliction for instance that was pretty dark character before did the scenes sitting around sissy spacek and nick nolte and would sitting around telling jokes and stories and just carrying when was time bang into that thing change you could just turn especially when you got script paul schrader gooding someday you have work with him because his scripts are clear and concise you just read them and you know exactly what gooding realize the importance being the same wavelength director you guys aren clicking man return the recommendation coburn says you should work with paul schrader then should work with gooding coburn have you ever worked with james brooks brilliant and his mind constantly going cameron crowe another one like that these two guys they were joy work with another guy would fun but haven worked with long wolfgang peterson but you worked with some heavy guys coburn they all dead laughs still around and they gone and left man peckinpah course and john sturges sam think was favorite with peck was always chaos was like walking into world total chaos all the time every day and thrived the chaos the energy threw off because most his films were about chaotic situations the los angeles
