cranes with super magnets toss smashed washing machines junked cars and rusted train tracks like paper clips trucks with tires tall elephant slop through the stinking oil fouled mud dumping new loads with unceremonious crash here this jersey city scrapyard front different pile wreckage that anamaria bonilla structural engineer falls her knees with the sleeve her sweat shirt she rubs furiously the rusty surface foot long world trade center column that has caught her trained eye cluster other engineers with charts tape measures and palm pilots gather around her the hint code painted onto the steel more than years ago surfaces rolling over almost her back seek other markings she knows must there bonilla slides her head between the underside the column and the mud and reads out loud what she finds one one she says the 101st floor says fellow investigator david sharp after also squeezes into the gap confirming the markings bonilla found was potentially important discovery but part result happenstance from the moment the two towers collapsed sept engineers and other experts have been struggling answer the monumental questions exactly why and how the buildings designed sustain jet impact completely collapsed but despite promises broad federal investigation and after weeks calls from victims families and others halt the destruction the steel that could hold all sorts clues the half heroic half comic scenes the jersey city scrapyard continue play out small teams engineers plot slightly mad dashes like mountain goats into mounds steel claim pieces tower columns the engineers time their forays avoid being crushed indeed bonilla made her find while the scrapyard workers were their lunch break through all the engineers profess optimism that they are catching and saving what most useful but they concede that there way saying for sure unknown number steel columns has been sent off mills far away asia without ever having been examined saved what they doing extremely noble ambitious and wonderful and glad somebody doing that said james quintiere professor fire protection engineering the university maryland but added the steel almost foregone conclusion that gone the organizers the steel recovery effort will not say how many pieces total have been set aside for future study saying only that more than from among the hundreds thousands world trade center steel parts but without doubt the teams surveying have made some important discoveries the steel column identified last wednesday bonilla with its brackets bolts and two pairs winglike steel plates still attached potentially critical discovery ran three stories from the 98th the 101st floor the exterior face one tower just above the zones struck jets laden with fuel now that has been found and spray painted with the word save florescent orange paint tests can conducted determine whether heat stress some design material flaw might have let fail another crumpled steel member set aside keasbey scrapyard has markings clearly showing that ran the east face the north tower from the 92nd the 95th floor the center one impact zone pieces steel have also been found that were apparently melted and vaporized not solely because the heat fires but also because corrosive contaminant that was somehow released the conflagrations and unexpectedly cracked washers crucial connections the towers are being closely scrutinized the organized steel recovery effort one piece three tiered investigation the american society civil engineers coordination with the federal emergency management agency has set panel engineering and fire experts who are assembling photographs witness interviews and other data try determine why the towers collapsed the volunteer effort organized the structural engineers association new york the team primary source raw steel evidence from the site volunteers from the structural engineers association visited ground zero first early october and identified handful steel samples they wanted save but was not until the start november that three separate teams started visit the steel yards regular basis since then about visits have been made the three recycling yards and the fresh kills landfill staten island where some steel also being sent much the effort focused trying find steel that was above the floors rammed the hijacked jets the towers collapsed from the top down and the fires were concentrated these areas the presumption that the answer why they fell down should found examining the steel from these spots when the towers were built markings were inscribed the steel columns indicate their exact positions but with the damage from the fire and collapse many those markings cannot found instead the engineers measure the width the steel the higher the building the thinner for example plates that are inch thick used connect columns were used only above the 80th floor the engineers who more typically are manhattan offices designing bridges high rises visit the scrapyards sporadic schedule sometimes taking vacation days make for the absences from their regular jobs the teams about people are involved all are made mixture some the city most established structural engineers like edward depaola principal sevrerud associates and younger engineers like bonilla who works for california based engineering company bonilla who spent many days rooftops during her years working carpenter before she became engineer one the most aggressive spotters bounding into the steel piles even before the others have climbed out rusty chevrolet truck that drives them around the jersey city scrapyard called hugo neu schnitzer east other members the group handle the detailed measurements and take photographs each piece steel they intend save some expeditions the yards not single piece considered worth saving identified other days whole cache potentially important scraps found every day productive even you don find anything you have sense that least you looked said depaola whose company served the structural engineer for projects including the denver international airport and the reuters building times square that recently opened like doctors performing autopsy after mysterious death the evidence these engineers collect the raw material that after scrutiny laboratories around the united states could provide the answer and have impact far beyond the world trade center out the scrapyard the engineers who volunteer their labor give various reasons for their presence some like sharp knew people who died the attack others cite sense obligation help out the face such catastrophe the firemen certainly made the ultimate sacrifice bonilla says did the police engineer you somehow feel like you have duty supply some answer
