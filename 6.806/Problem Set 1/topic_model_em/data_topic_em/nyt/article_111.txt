what time for promotion richard parsons chief operating officer aol time warner will not become the company chief executive until may but already acting has job and already apparent that the job will even harder than many media professionals would have expected when his promotion was announced barely more than month ago have theory life things never get easier they only get harder parsons said wednesday think the current environment makes more interesting certainly more challenging that environment includes the write off billion billion that will taken reflect some the decline the value the company since the merger america online and time warner was announced january the challenges are reflected the reduction monday the company cash flow target for range percent percent many analysts had expected percent more least two things are now clear first the advertising market remains horrid the aol internet unit will hard pressed make significant contribution cash flow growth this year fact aol time warner meets the growth target the stars will probably its cable television systems and its film studio units that appeared stodgy just few years ago second even the cable television and film units have stellar years the company will still probably have cut hundreds millions dollars costs meet even its lowered expectations for now the most important financial yardstick for aol time warner and most other media companies remains cash flow measured earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda accounting the company had already completed its pending acquisitions bertelsmann percent stake aol europe and ipc european publishing company appears that when aol time warner announces results for later this month will report about billion ebitda the company generate growth the middle its projected range for this year percent then must come with about million additional cash flow where could come from since the merger the financial bedrock aol time warner has been its cable television business which has about million subscribers now that the unit broadly offering cable modem and digital television service features that can generate additional revenue appears set contribute perhaps million additional cash flow this year financially aol time warner lumps its film and television production and distribution operations into what called the filmed entertainment group perhaps the biggest problem that group that reaped around million cash flow selling syndication rights the smash hit seinfeld and friends sitcoms and has nothing comparable stature sell syndication this year that will make tougher for the unit show year over year growth still the unit poised reap bonanza from the home video and dvd releases the popular harry potter and lord the rings films the end enough people will probably want invite wizards and goblins into their homes offset the unit deficit syndication the unit could post perhaps million additional ebitda this year additional million million new cash flow could come from the company publishing operation though magazine advertising remains weak the newly acquired european ipc group which produces titles including loaded and horse amp hound appears doing fairly well but advertising weakness will make difficult for aol time warner cable television networks which include tbs and cnn avoid falloff cash flow and though the warner music group unit trying regain momentum continues struggle along with most the music industry too will well tread water where does this leave the aol internet service which was meant the company growth engine tough spot the recent collapse the unit iplanet joint venture with sun microsystems which was meant help companies expand their internet presence will take about million cash flow away from the aol division the demise iplanet will probably offset reduction losses aol europe perhaps million from about million last year yet the online advertising market anything even worse shape than traditional advertising the internet unit saving grace could that will continue add millions subscribers even aol time warner probably cannot count the unit deliver much more than million million additional cash flow altogether the numbers add about million new cash flow would surprise however see aol cut its costs perhaps million top the reduction aol europe that means total million new cash flow which would just get the company percent ebitda growth the low end its target everything top that would gravy making parsons first year the job much easier attention editors all photos
