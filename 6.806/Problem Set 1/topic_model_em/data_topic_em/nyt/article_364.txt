west palm beach fla known all puerto rican poet playwright miguel pinero remembered for his prison play short eyes and for some acting and writing assignments miami vice and kojak but director leon ichaso sensed that pinero was gradually being forgotten and was determined stop that from happening went bit mission because saw miguel pinero falling through the cracks says the cuban born ichaso you couldn find his books you couldn find his movies even though his body work not that huge this life that should known that could all change with the release ichaso low budget impressionistic biography called simply pinero starring benjamin bratt formerly law and order with performance being touted for oscar consideration pinero died years ago cirrhosis the liver brought drug and alcohol abuse got the way his own success with life crime and never stopped says ichaso his substance dependence don think could imagine pinero step program meeting saying name mikey pinero and dope fiend there lesson learned from pinero life says the director that let the drugs get the way his talent stylistically ichaso kept his film raw and jumpy effort echo pinero writing style tried preserve that artistic chaos throughout his life explains keep disorderly possible get know the man the artist and see life through his eyes much possible think that lot times films are too glossy and too slick and don allow get into the story ichaso who also wrote the movie screenplay has been making films for more than years including the spanish language love story bitter sugar set against the politics contemporary cuba the gritty harlem drug drama sugar hill featuring wesley snipes and recent biographies rocker jimi hendrix boxer pacifist muhammad ali and san francisco assassin dan white they were all outsiders says the latter subjects much more interested people like that agrees that most directors might not think bratt play pinero since the performer more famous for dating julia roberts than for his acting skill but they would they saw him follow home directed bratt brother peter when watched had glimpse benjamin bratt who was not the boyfriend and nor the pretty boy detective curtis from law and order says played mural artist from east used prosthetic teeth shaved his head had his body all tattooed definitely gave glimpse where could film that interests him and began meet with him and talk with him and realized that was fearless says ichaso there were other actors considered for pinero and benjamin was the only one that wasn afraid the subject rather than having sell bratt taking the role which would clearly boost the film marketability ichaso says that was bratt who pitched hard land the assignment even though the first thing said when met was know not your man but maybe that was his reverse psychology make him more attractive bratt far from pinero possible from the west coast incredibly healthy man athlete surfer never used drugs his life says ichaso yet bratt immersed himself completely the role was like mikey took over ichaso already had the film financing secured the time bratt signed thanks small company called greenestreet films think they felt that was risk but that also had commercial potential the director comments very low budget movie shot for million days and got assemble pretty good cast with that addition bratt pinero features rita moreno mandy patinkin robert klein and giancarlo esposito actors who knew the playwright new york public theatre asked there was anything could not afford the tight budget ichaso does not hesitate more time would have rather worked with rita moreno week instead two days but sometimes that also gives urgency the storytelling that you can actually see the screen later his hope for the film says ichaso last recognized the critics and the people and discovered just like discovered pinero and became interested enough making the movie and that could perhaps open some doors for all referring hispanic artists establishing career filmmaker has been continual struggle for ichaso director future always tied the last film has made unless you are part the club then you can make mistakes and they still give you more money for the next one the reactions pinero have been extreme far that just fine with ichaso that type film says cannot expect you sit theater watching some the scenes with needles sex whatever and just smile and say like this the construction the script and the film itself very difficult for some people who are used more conventional biographical linear approach the bottom line this the way was difficult understand but very interesting hap erstein writes for the palm beach florida post mail haperstein pbpost com story filed cox newspapers for thursday ams here are today top news stories
