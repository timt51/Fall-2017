wrenching loss this the home monsanto which brought the world its first genetically engineered crops was technology that could fight world hunger and turn tidy profit the bargain but that hopeful science serious trouble for years scientists have talked day when genetic engineering would make crops resistant disease and expand food itself into nutraceuticals cancer fighting tomatoes and vaccine laden bananas were some the foods blessed with these genetic enhancements the world first nutraceutical experimental variety golden rice genetically engineered contain high levels beta carotene being stalled opponents who fear dire environmental consequences and the tyranny big business over small third world farmers the hybrid rice offers the possibility countering the ravages vitamin deficiency which affects some million children worldwide the anti forces are definitely limiting the development the technology its earliest phase said gary toenniessen the rockefeller foundation which has funded much the called green revolution the scientific enhancement crops too bad say critics the biotech industry has tried market itself fighting world hunger they contend without delivering the goods these private companies jumped over the fence where was low they did what they could the quickest and least expensive way argues per pinstrup anderson director general the international food policy research institute washington they did not act based what was best for society not very hopeful for poor people developing countries monsanto sprawling facilities here and nearby chesterfield corn cotton and soybeans are arrayed steamy rooftop greenhouses there sign experimental vegetables with vitamin antioxidant with possible preventive relationship cancer attempts redraw the genetic makeup bananas produce vaccines against hepatitis tooth decay asked where all the nutraceutical research monsanto scientists shrug their shoulders and say they don see part their business for now scientists here and elsewhere draw distinction between crops that are engineered genetically resist insects disease and the like and crops that may morphed into more nutritious food the latter that makes environmentalists and social activists most nervous monsanto owned pharmacia and other agricultural giants including syngenta dupont and dow already are raking billions dollars sales insect and herbicide resistant crops those genetic enhancements are soaring popularity with farmers exceeding levels predicted government experts more than million acres percent the soybeans farmers are growing are genetically engineered compared with percent year ago according the department agriculture about percent million acres this year cotton crop genetically engineered planting biotech corn percent this year total acreage but farmers have shunned biotech versions sugar beets potatoes and sweet corn because major processors packers and food companies such hershey foods and mcdonald say they are unwilling buy the genetically engineered products before take more risk would like see products that have direct consumer benefit fast track said gene grabowski spokesman for the grocers manufacturers association major food industry trade group food makers are growing tired assuming the risks genetically modified crops without being able offer any direct benefits their customers said bit standoff said waiting for something new before accept anything else and the agricultural companies are hesitating too that where stands scientists are discovering what possible with biotechnology and society deciding what wants according david evans syngenta head research and technology with its american division based wilmington del syngenta was formed the agribusiness merger novartis and astrazeneca the company spends million year research its scientists are working bananas that are resistant fungus and tomatoes with anti cancer properties sure there will some things that science could that one will want and some things that people will want that can evans said what trying find those areas where can achieve some meeting the minds and where society prepared pay for them this cautious approach adds the already laborious process developing and testing new strains syngenta plodding along with its effort increase the amount lycopene believed counter the effects chemicals that damage tissue and cause cancer tomatoes marketable version expected before genetically engineered golden rice developed two european scientists combat vitamin deficiency may the test case for all other futuristic foods developed over decade and still need laboratory tweaking the rice has become the focal point international protest movement july united nations officials embraced biotech important food technology for the developing world anxiously awaited report according the development program report scientists should allowed enough time see golden rice can perfected look heartening see someone making something that relevant developing countries said kate raworth economist addition the golden rice project monsanto scientists are working red gold golden mustard seed oil india both contain enhanced levels the building blocks vitamin developing these crops takes years some believe companies such monsanto may running out time biotechnology powerful technology with the potential create remarkable new products said mike rodemeyer executive director the pew initiative food and biotechnology nonprofit group tracking the industry however many these products are likely generate significant public debate over their relative risks and benefits the united states canada and argentina are the primary growers genetically modified crops the developing world only china actively encouraging its progress the varieties are not popular with farmers europe where consumers reject the technology for environmental and health reasons asia the indian government has not yet approved any genetically modified crops for release and even china has not approved any new crops months while some the third world opposition biotechnology motivated anti corporate anti american sentiment the underlying concerns are about the potential impact the environment and human health all for food with unproven benefits new investments are blocked this political resistance then the time need develop these techniques will pushed back way over the horizon said robert paarlberg professor political science wellesley college who studies agricultural policy and that will serious loss for the world optional trim begins not just politics that slowing the biotech advances for decades wealthy countries supported agricultural research centers the developing world prompting the green revolution these nonprofit centers produced new agricultural techniques and gave them away for free farmers funding the research centers has been sharp decline for decade wealthy countries have invested the money instead global environmental efforts and the increasing use patents protect new high tech life forms including plants has complicated the giveaway needy growers golden rice according its promoters now should have ignited the interest farmers poor countries everywhere instead crossroad and unclear what direction golden rice and other engineered foods will take optional trim ends have reached juncture important world history and its future relation its food supply said prakash prominent plant breeder tuskegee university alabama ask myself what happens golden rice and other things like don happen then shudder coalition environmental anti globalization and peasant farmer groups has pledged block the rice every advance from now until doomsday the golden rice advocates say they the distance with controversial open air testing may have china them said gurdav khush the international rice research institute the philippines where opponents have pledged prevent the field tests vital proving the crop viability the meantime the rice inventors ingo potrykus and peter beyer are continuing their research they are trying boost levels beta carotene the grain even they concede they don know how effectively the human body can use the enhanced vitamin the best standard bearer for golden rice the moment may quiet spoken economist named howarth bouis who works for the international food policy institute washington tapping into some new sources funding golden rice offers society daring new way launch assault the world hidden hunger argues referring people who have food but lack access nutritious sustenance this point substantial funds have not been invested the strategy bouis declares you can probably develop golden rice and prove everything you want for about million far bouis has won million funding from the agency for international development but his best hope for more money from the bill and melinda gates foundation founded the microsoft billionaire the foundation already funding major efforts aids vaccine development malaria research and vitamin fortification programs the developing world more research not forthcoming from somewhere the questions about golden rice and similar foods may never settled says ron cantrell director the international rice research institute and argues that would tragedy the battle against world hunger lots people think the problem has been solved cantrell said yet you still have million people who bed hungry each night end macpherson kitta macpherson writes about science for the star ledger newark she can contacted kmacpherson
