titles can serve words invitation into the world artwork how this for ballet title quartet for strings does that excite your curiosity set you quivering with anticipation well then what about this one telemann overture suite minor those are the titles two new works the new york city ballet has been offering during its winter season the new york state theater quartet verdi neatly made but uncompelling piece peter martins telemann the promising choreographic debut melissa barak member the company however what worth considering here not the artistic quality those ballets but their titles and what those titles reveal both about the new york city ballet and about much recent american choreography for ballet and modern dance alike american dance obsessed with even tyrannized music course dance and music have been partners for ages and deserve continue their pas deux yet fundamentally dance does not need music dance needs rhythm and rhythms can established the regular irregular ways bodies move space even without vocal instrumental accompaniment thus some choreographers have created effective dances silence sound effects most choreographers though like music and not hard understand why music sounds good can intensify mood atmosphere and its formal sonic patterns can suggest movement patterns nevertheless dance not subdivision music but independent art and dance works are more than music appreciation lessons much american dance addiction music can traced the influence george balanchine great choreographer who was musically sensitive extraordinary degree and who titled many but means all his ballets after the scores which they were set even renamed some productions honor their music thus his ballet imperial has since been known tchaikovsky piano concerto and palais cristal created became symphony year later until his death continued naming ballets after scores among his works being danced this season new york city ballet are divertimento duo concertant kammermusik stravinsky violin concerto and tchaikovsky suite other choreographers for the company have sometimes followed his example quartet and telemann demonstrate and ballet and modern dance groups around the country often choose similar musical titles for works there nothing necessarily wrong with this practice choreographers should have the freedom call dances anything they choose just abstract painters have been known give canvases with slashing lines and vibrant colors such noncommittal titles may yet this proliferation musically titled dances makes fear that many choreographers may limiting their inspiration music alone balanchine once termed music floor for dancing image implying that dances are like houses but houses have features other than floors for instance they have windows and doors which the outside world can let out too other factors than music can influence dance indeed aspiring choreographers might find valuable study painting and sculpture gain sense volume shape and grouping literature and mythology may provide ideas for dramatic emotional content historical periods and awareness the clothes and etiquette those periods might challenge choreographers devise striking ways moving and there reason ignore the excitement contemporary life outside the dance studio course audiences have often had sigh over emotionally excessive dramatically lugubrious dances filled with grimaces pompous poses and frantic arm waving and such histrionics have turned both expressionist modern dance and ballets inspired literary classics however audiences today must their own sighing over musically based dances which the sounds the notes performers jump about with more precision than expression they were nothing more than metronomes with feet addition rousing fears that titles based scores may indicate restriction choreographic imagination such titles are bothersome simply because they are dull how can they possibly rouse audience interest anyone prosaic think tchaikovsky piano concerto more appealing than ballet imperial conceivably choreographers may not want reveal too much with their titles and thereby rob theatergoers the thrill discovering new work content balanchine himself may have occasionally wished surprise audiences one the most cumbersome and for anyone not fluent german unpronounceable titles the entire balanchine canon robert schumann davidsbuendlertanze that title simultaneously musically correct and emotionally neutral hinting nothing whatsoever about what goes this work from first the ballet appears depict people party then balanchine throws his surprises the choreographic tone gradually darkens until one realizes that this not just ballet about party but somber portrait man the brink madness first viewing schumann sometimes called can genuinely startling but once people see schumann any other work with comparable musical title more than once its content will longer new them fortunately however the choreography imaginative that schumann certainly the work may still thrilling then why settle for dull titles many occasions consider some titles other distinguished choreographers among the works the paul taylor dance company will present during its season city center opening feb are aureole black tuesday dandelion wine and speaking tongues here are more titles errand into the maze seraphic dialogue acrobats god and deaths and entrances martha graham jardin aux lilas lilac garden pillar fire undertow and echoing trumpets antony tudor and fancy free interplay age anxiety and the night jerome robbins such titles give few secrets away yet they may well stir audience interest since robbins set the night chopin nocturnes could have turned musical purist and called simply nocturnes not bad title but surely not quite appealing the night perhaps choreographers should take special care think about their titles and free themselves from balanchinan strictures the attempt devise good title either before during the actual choreographic rehearsal process might help focus their imaginations and prevent the completed piece from seeming fuzzy barak new telemann for instance was always gracious yet one could raise the faint complaint that whole was bit too unrelievedly mild what might have been the result she had titled with some word phrase that for her conveyed the essence what she sought reveal about the score would coming with such title have encouraged her brighten her choreography although dance nonverbal art the intellectual rigors search for title might conceivably help make dance work more choreographically vivid music not the only valid choreographic inspiration musical titles are not necessarily the best ones for dances and any case audiences will surely attracted attractive titles which title more alluring symphony palais cristal symphony can almost anything but crystal palace promises sparkle and living its original title balanchine ballet does sparkle for saturday ams
