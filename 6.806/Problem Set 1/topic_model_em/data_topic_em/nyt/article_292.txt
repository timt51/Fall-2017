lawmakers and environmentalists accused the department energy tuesday ignoring public demands thoroughly clean soils laced with low level radioactive waste the former rocketdyne nuclear research facility the simi hills doe officials have recommended leaving about percent truckloads the contaminated soil place the hills between chatsworth and simi valley decision that would increase cancer risk rates times over the level sought the community critics have challenged the doe plan great part because the site could developed for homes other uses once the cleanup completed the doe recommended standard for the cleaning its portion the santa susana field laboratory would allow risk rate cancers per million people maximum exposure from the site compared with one per million state sen sheila kuehl democrat who represents the area from santa monica the southern end the san fernando valley charged the doe with caving business and other interests rather than listening residents who must live near the lab kuehl who said she drafting legislation that would impose the higher cleanup standard that the environmental protection agency encourages its superfund cleanup sites said the doe misled residents recommending cleanup standard she called way too low with acceptable cancer risk rate that too high worse than dissing the public kuehl said sort building hopes fair process which you might participate and then they doe officials say thank you very much for your input but going ignore cleaning contamination the santa susana field laboratory has been issue since when the daily news disclosed that years rocket and nuclear fuel research had left extensive contamination sen dianne feinstein calif also concerned with the doe recommendation her spokesman howard gantman said said she had hoped they doe would have moved aggressively the higher standard and that she intends urge the doe reconsider its recommendation she also plans renew her request epa administrator christine todd whitman require the higher standard want able assure the community that the area safe gantman said the proposal leave nearly truckloads contaminated soil the former cold war nuclear research facility will the subject two public input sessions thursday the grand vista hotel enchanted way simi valley the two hour sessions will begin and whitman eight months ago reassured both feinstein and sen barbara boxer calif the agency would ensure that the cleanup consistent with superfund cleanup standards although the facility not the superfund list whitman spokeswoman steffanie bell said tuesday that the epa administrator remains committed making sure the cleanup santa susana field laboratory protective the public and the environment regional epa official added that the agency wants the best cleanup possible all contaminated sites cancer risk one million reasonable and possible that what like see said larry bowerman chief the epa region resource conservation and recovery act corrective action office san francisco daniel hirsch president committee bridge the gap nonprofit nuclear watchdog group and monitor the site for years charged the doe with hiding behind interpretation federal regulations that would allow end the cleanup three years sooner doe estimates and far less cost human terms this means kids will playing top that percent contaminated soil that was left place hirsch said the site were sold for development because its panoramic views the san fernando and simi valleys dan beck spokesman for the boeing which now owns rocketdyne said the company committed cleanup that protects the public health haven foreclosed any option including residential beck called hyperbolic assertions hirsch and others that the doe signaling the end the cleanup which

standard for the cleanup falls within the epa range for land that can then released for use including homes and that the agency responsibly considered the public concerns were trying responsive the public said mike lopez the doe oakland manager the environmental restoration project for the part the lab known the energy technology engineering center felt obliged give the lower cancer risk rate option serious consideration lopez said the doe believes that the proposed standard will adequately protect the public while avoiding transporting nearly cubic meters soil contaminated with low level radioactive waste enough cover about football fields with one foot layer dirt through streets and freeways disposal sites there are trade offs lopez said there are transportation accidents one issue that gets people attention traffic this would most likely down woolsey canyon road down plummer roscoe the doe preferred option were adopted only cubic meters soil contaminated with the low level radioactive waste would removed from acre portion the acre doe lab leaving the rest virtually untouched since already meets the higher cancer risk standard our review not done until the comment period completed lopez added community activists representing hundreds thousands residents within mile radius have demanded that the land scrubbed thoroughly before being reused particularly since health studies the university california los angeles showed worker exposure external radiation the nuclear research lab was associated with elevated cancer death rates peter strauss president the san francisco consulting firm strauss amp associates said has worked several superfund sites the state which community pressure was instrumental getting government agencies clean the sites lower cancer risk rates there are strong communities they regulators try push get risk rate near one cancer per million unless they can show there are really good technical reasons why they can strauss said about money said doe budget has been cut back good deal something going cut going cleanup lopez disputed that money played role the recommendation saying the doe expressly prohibited from weighing cost against health and safety didn figure into
