most homeowners have had the experience standing under sinfully hot shower only notice almost imperceptibly first and then with chilling rapidity that the water temperature changing from hot warm lukewarm cooler whoa out here wouldn nice able have all hot water all the time well plumbers and energy efficiency experts say possible the breakthrough called tankless hot water and while the equipment costs more than traditional system lasts much longer and the operating costs are usually lower the person who invented tank type hot water heaters invented the car you never turn off your engine said kyle murray marketing director for the controlled energy corp distributor tankless hot water heaters waitsfield while murray analogy may stretched bit illustrates the basic difference between tankless water heaters and those cylindrical gas electric hot water heating and storage tanks many homes with standard tank type heater murray said the water the tank heated preset temperature usually degrees fahrenheit and then kept that temperature hours day whenever someone the house uses the hot water the gas electric heating element the tank switches heat the cold water replenishing the tank and bring the temperature the entire tank back the desired setting but the work tank type water heater not limited times that the hot water tap open murray said since even the most efficient hot water storage tanks lose heat when they are not being used the heating element works day and night keep the water the tank hot and ready for use stored water tank type heater loses much percent its heat the flue gas fired system murray said adding that while electric water heaters lose less heat because they not have flue such heaters are typically more expensive operate than gas units murray said that most tankless water heaters have copper heat exchangers through which the water flows being used instead maintaining preset temperature switching and off throughout the day however tankless hot water heater produces heat only when water flowing explained that when the hot water tap sink appliance turned the flow water activates switch that turns the heating element that element which can electric powered fueled natural propane gas then heats the water passing through the heat exchanger for long the water continues flowing result with appropriately sized tankless hot water system there will virtually endless supply heated water carsten ginsburg president empowerco alternative energy systems company summit said that gas powered tankless water heater can percent more energy efficient than gas powered tank type heater and percent more energy efficient than electric unit and while the standard pilot light used some tankless heaters can reduce the appliance energy efficiency newer tankless heaters have either hard wired battery powered electric pilots that produce spark ignite the gas when the unit switches among the other advantages tankless hot water heaters ginsberg said are their longevity tankless units can operate for years without requiring service while tank type heaters generally have replaced every years great tankless hot water heaters may seem however they have some shortcomings henry gifford president gifford fuel savings inc manhattan heating and ventilation design and consulting company said for example that while tankless heaters can indeed supply seemingly endless amount hot water they can only the unit properly sized for the demand will subjected gifford explained that since tankless heater heats only water passing through the flow rate the unit critical tankless heater that has flow rate say gallons per minute should able quickly raise the temperature that amount water flowing through from about degrees degrees and then maintain that temperature for long the water continues flowing the problem however that when the flow water through such unit more than gallons per minute the water moving too fast heated the desired temperature gifford said dishwasher turned while person taking shower thereby increasing the flow water through the heater there possibility that the water temperature both the dishwasher and the shower head will lower than desired you have make sure that you have unit that properly sized for your house gifford said another problem with some older tankless heaters said that the flow water through the unit low the heating element has cycle and off prevent the water from becoming too hot that means that water temperature can terribly inaccurate gifford said offering his own automotive analogy like trying maintain the speed your car turning the ignition and off pointed out that newer tankless heating units the market eliminate that problem using modulating energy input technology with such heaters instead turning the heating element and off produce the desired temperature the unit instead increases decreases energy the heating element maintain constant temperature matter how much water flowing through the unit another problem with tankless heaters gifford said that they typically require larger vent hole than the tank type heaters they often replace result said install such unit the vent must enlarged from the standard inches diameter inches failure provide properly sized vent gifford said can result dangerous levels carbon monoxide backing into the house michael lamb certified energy manager for the energy efficiency and renewable energy clearinghouse service the department energy said that all tankless and tank type water heaters sold this country must tested for safety and should carry safety labels standard tankless hot water heater for one family house would cost about installed gallon replacement tank the other hand would run anywhere from installed since the cost operate the tankless units can year less than tank type heater with the actual savings depending the type fuel used and the efficiency the heater the price differential could quickly recovered
