every time you look into space you are looking far distant vistas that concept easy grasp because physical distance easy imagine know the moon long way off another planet circling our star even farther off and planet circling alien sun that way the heck out there but when look something far away space also looking scene that occurred some time the past that concept more difficult but here how works light that born within the heart the sun for instance takes billions years travel from the core photons light energy are generated within the nuclear reactions that fuel each and every star these photons travel the speed light miles per second outward from the core within the star they encounter turbulent areas vast energies and gases that slow their escape radically that takes them billions years reach the surface once there photon light from the sun takes another eight minutes reach that means when look and see the sun the sky really seeing the sun appeared eight minutes ago not right this moment you had rocket that could reach the sun instantly and you aimed right the sun you see the sky you would miss wide margin because the sun longer where appears effect already eight minutes ahead the future places greater distances are even further removed time jupiter roughly light minutes away million miles when you spot jupiter the sky you looking into the past how jupiter appeared minutes ago the nearest star little over four light years away modern telescopes have spotted galaxies over million light years distant and more recent discoveries are well into the billions the farther peer into the vastness space the farther back time will see perhaps even far back near the very beginning the universe itself when man finally climbs into the reaches interstellar space the issue time will more than interesting astronomical tidbit the hurdles fuels and speed are issue and can reach any star set our eyes may not there when arrive least not how first spied the star betelgeuse orion massive supergiant that the final stages its life any day now will blow itself smithereens betelgeuse about light years away however and may very well have blown already the light that explosion just hasn reached here yet the next time someone says that time travel impossible tell them you every day highlights tuesday twilight fades this evening look low the southwest for the waxing crescent moon its lower right about the width your fist held arm length mercury farther the moon left fomalhaut the brightest star the constellation piscis austrinus wednesday the crescent moon hangs about midway between mars far its upper left and mercury far its lower right closer the moon lower left sparkles fomalhaut friday mars shines the moon upper right this evening saturday jupiter moon crosses the planet face tonight from followed its tiny but much more visible shadow from michael alicea writes for the palm beach post have question about the heavens send skylights the palm beach post dixie highway west palm beach email michaelalicea pbpost com story filed cox newspapers
