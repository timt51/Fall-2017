the region from posts farflung germany australia and the netherlands bring old south stereotypes the crime post modern narrative kids adrift world cool casual violence for these people arkansas inbred backwater trailer strewn landscape where teeth are scarce and ignorance rampant where drawling god fearing cops judges and juries couldn anything but hostile toward kids who run around town wearing metallica shirts this interpretation west memphis where goth meets southern gothic spring afternoon the hog tied bodies three year old boys were found robin hood hills acre patch scratchy woods behind the blue beacon truck wash they had been murdered question though remains unclear exactly what hour second graders from the adjoining subdivision who been out riding bikes the evening before steve

constitute just about the last unambiguous elements this case was horrific crime maybe this town worst ever and its eye averting ghastliness may partly explain whatever investigative missteps followed there need retry that investigation here the wm3 crowd does obsessively internet message boards the mother lode site www wm3 org suffice say the crime scene yielded little physical evidence tying the teens the killings blood fingerprints murder weapon there was clothing fiber that pointed the suspects knife was fished months later from lake behind one defendant house that prosecutors said was consistent with the murder weapon witness said she saw one the teens near the crime scene around the time could have occurred two others say they overheard echols boasting about the murders girls softball game and there was confession jessie misskelley then told police that jason baldwin then and echols the year old ringleader murdered the boys described the killings drunken idle time eruption and his own role that active reluctant bystander kept one kid from running away before fleeing himself the problem with the confession defense lawyers and wm3 supporters see misskelley has registered the lows 70s borderline retarded and his confession initially confused basic facts like whether the murders occurred the morning night later recanted confessed twice more more incriminating detail then retracted those confessions too was case that prosecutor john fogleman admitted had little direct evidence the circumstantial evidence was enough convince two different juries but not enough preclude sundry threads speculation like small scale version the kennedy assassination post warren report the case virtually begs for interpretations the official record you begin explore this story and keeps opening like onion says mara leverett arkansas writer whose book the murders due out october people are drawn who have sense there should rational explanation they not satisfied with physical evidence and satanic motive case where you can see what you want see you can see town caught satanic panic evidence was presented that echols read stephen king novels listened metallica wrote occult based musings and investigarors heard stories that participated orgies and animal sacrifices you can see detectives working confession from weak minded teen all sudden the local retarded kid comes forward who they can pressure into saying whatever they want says misskelley lawyer dan stidham you can see other suspects these include bojangles man bloodied drifter who appeared nearby bojangles restaurant the night the murders then disappeared before police arrived and mark byers christopher bizarrely posturing stepfather you can see media high alert that turned some lawyers parents and defendants into actors playing outsized roles themselves and you can see all two hbo documentaries themselves part the media frenzy paradise lost the child murders robin hood hills which won peabody award and its sequel four years later paradise lost revelations new york based filmmakers joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky were lured west memphis after reading brief newspaper account the murders they initially assumed the teens guilt and were eager explore their disconnect bible thumping delta where berlinger puts there the idea heaven and hell and literal devil who runs among but after months filming the trials they were convinced the trio didn they made sequel drive that point home and hoped would lead the three release the arc travelled most wm3 supporters begins with these films which still air occasionally hbo and are available video stores the first leaves you suspicious about the teens convictions with echols starring bright darkly charismatic too cool cucumber the second removes any doubt just watched those documentaries and knew nothing else about the case would have questions too says capt mike allen the west memphis police who investigated the murders would say myself those boys may not have done there are thousand and one questions this crying shame but the reality hbo did one sided biased job allen says they did the case real injustice this country gets the point where instead trial say let have hbo what they and have people mail the courts well allen voice trails off then adds know the case can sleep night peace knowing who killed those kids
