years ago you wanted look volvos you could head the faculty parking lot any college the northeast there they would rows sensible sedans and wagons many them with miles more the odometers one might have wondered why given the region slippery winters these rear drive wagons were popular among the highly educated one reason was their reliability and another was that the cars had fairly good traction the snow despite their rear drive design partly because the wagons particular had some weight over the rear wheels and partly because volvos didn have lot wheel spinning power back then and the cars boxy practical designs affirmed their owners serious mien and their aversion fads lot about volvo has changed recent years the company incorporated front wheel drive for improved traction and space efficiency and spruced its styling and image the swedish company now member the ford motor premier automotive group along with prestigious names like aston martin jaguar and land rover the volvo product range has expanded include the s40 and v40 compacts the s80 luxury sedan the v70 and cross country wagons and the c70 luxury coupe and convertible the big volvo news this winter the xc90 sport utility which made its debut this month the detroit auto show plus the arrival model the company first all wheel drive sedan the s60 awd the awd uses horsepower version volvo liter cylinder engine other s60s come with horsepower has five speed automatic transmission that lets the driver shift gears manually nudging the shifter although you can get front drive s60 for little the awd base price test car sticker read all wheel drive least all wheel drive option quickly becoming badge honor the near luxury class having grown accustomed suvs consumers are reluctant give the safety and security four driving wheels and word has spread about the capable performance even dry roads all wheel drive audis and subarus for the s60 volvo chose not borrow the all wheel drive system from the cross country wagon but uses new unit created haldex sweden mechanical pump and wet multi plate clutch were added the s60 basic front drive platform distribute power the rear wheels electronic control senses when the front wheels are starting slip and forces oil into the clutch that connects the rear wheels volvo says this power sharing happens quickly that the driver senses nothing and experience that true such system weighs less and less complex and has little affect fuel economy the s60 attractively styled with the sort flowing roofline you expect coupe viewed from the rear the car wide stance gives capable stable appearance the good first impression enhanced the obvious quality the way the doors were made and how they fit well the materials and finish the interior the trunk also well finished the hinges are designed not impinge the space contrast the luggage squashing designs many domestic sedans the instrument panel also has high quality look incorporating clear sensible gauges and easy use climate control system this system has separate temperature controls for the driver and front passenger and also outlets the center pillars that direct air toward rear passengers the audio system takes some getting used and although applaud the lack push buttons found that the knobs that select the the radio stations and control the operating mode took eyes off the road for longer than like one would expect any volvo have array safety features and the s60 does the force the front air bags varies depending the severity crash the car distinctive body construction said offer extra protection side impacts along with the side air bags and inflatable curtain that when deployed covers the front and side windows also all the safety belts have pretensioners hold occupants tight crash and the front seat head restraints are designed guard against whiplash one new feature for the driver can press button the dashboard flip down the rear head restraints one seated the back eliminating potential blind spot the government attests the effectiveness several these safety features front test crash mph the driver and passenger positions each rated four stars out five the side crash test both front and rear seating positions received five stars the road the s60 ride was smooth and steady previous volvos built the front drive platform have had rather harsh jarring ride that wasn keeping with the european road car image that volvo would like cultivate found the ride smoother over most road surfaces than the audi the steering response and handling while bit less crisp than the audi were very good indeed the anti lock brakes which also have emergency brake assist feature apply maximum force panic stops were smooth and progressive typical volvo the front seats are large and very comfortable with wide range adjustments though would have liked more lower back support because the coupelike styling the rear seats are rather low giving occupants sitting hole sensation but the s60 european competitors not have generous rear seats either interior noise has lot with feeling comfort and was surprised the s60 low noise level the highway quieter ear than the for example the low pressure turbo gave smooth and quite powerful performance and noticed turbo lag the engine response the engine and transmission worked well together with seamless shifts and plenty acceleration when needed shift torque the rear wheels were imperceptible the government gives the s60 awd mileage rating town and the highway averaged mpg premium gasoline recommended for best performance but octane all that required according the owner manual the s60 competitors this class with all wheel drive are the audi the bmw series the jaguar and the mercedes class all are state the art european sports sedans and all are excellent performers advice try them all they may all have equivalent features but their personalities are different
