president bush announced his long awaited plans thursday for slowing the buildup gases linked climate change and for cutting power plant pollution his speech made thursday afternoon government climate and oceans research center here elicited clashing choruses criticism and praise from advocates and politicians arguing over the best way cut emissions called greenhouse gases while minimizing the burden the economy bush made clear that for him the economy came first not just for its own sake but because said thriving economy was necessary build wealth that could used improve conditions the planet approach recognizes that economic growth the solution not the problem said with his address bush essentially provided his answer international treaty intended lower emissions carbon dioxide and other heat trapping gases that his administration rejected march that time also abandoned campaign pledge cut power plant emissions carbon dioxide and three other pollutants not until now has his cabinet been able agree substitute proposals the treaty that bush rejected the kyoto protocol has been agreed but not ratified almost every other industrial power and developing country would require prompt and mandatory reductions gas emissions levels well below those bush rejected the treaty saying would burden the american economy and unfairly exempt major developing countries the plan bush announced thursday would rely voluntary measures only and allow gas emissions continue rise with the goal slowing the rate growth utilities and energy companies expressed support for bush plans through their trade groups environmental campaigners expressed dismay including some greenpeace demonstrators who stood outside the commerce department building waving wads fake dollar bills and mock climate action plan stamped red with the words exxonmobil approved the climate the administration wants stick with inducements instead requirements using tax breaks and the prospect future trade emissions credits encourage industry and individuals trim releases the warming gases but trying minimize the costs his critics said bush had settled strategy that would provide few results and that some limits emissions would inevitably necessary bush said his goal would nudge the curve emissions down enough save million metric tons carbon dioxide the equivalent taking million cars off the road bush said planned promote this measured voluntary means dealing with climate change visits china south korea and japan next week saying that was important find way encourage developing countries join rich ones reducing the growth the called greenhouse gases japan has strongly supported the kyoto treaty which was negotiated there but japanese officials have been eager for some sign action the united states before pursuing its ratification bush said china india and and other large countries with fast growing economies were already the dominant source warming gases would irresponsible absolve them from shouldering some the shared obligations said the united states remains the single largest producer greenhouse emissions generating about percent the global total another central element his climate plan would expand system created under his father administration which businesses would voluntarily report their emissions and granted credits that could later prove valuable emissions trading system were adopted only hinted that prospect though saying that only after would there assessment how the country was doing without concrete caps cleaning power plants though bush said voluntary system would not bush view power plant pollution possess clear health risk while the threat global warming remains less certain echoing recent bipartisan proposals congress called for deep mandatory reductions three kinds pollutants from power plants sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and mercury all which contribute health problems and harm the environment but play significant role global warming proposing legislation that has called new clean air act for the 21st century bush said that sulfur dioxide would drop percent nitrogen oxides which spawn smog would drop percent over the same span and mercury percent proposed fundamental redesign existing plant regulations ending jumble individual restrictions various compounds with other proposals evolving congress his plan would allow industries achieve reductions trading emissions credits environmental groups and democrats including gore pounced bush plans saying they followed industry dictates and would result little improvement beyond existing laws and trends david hawkins the climate policy director for the natural resources defense council private group said the plans for climate and power plants mirrored the views the energy department and companies that sell use large amounts coal oil and other fossil fuels the main source carbon dioxide every number every date are the numbers and dates that they advocated said but others involved the debate were more content kevin fay the executive director the international climate change partnership which represents multinational manufacturers who support some climate controls said bush proposal was starting point for moving ahead with legislation and new environmental rules the most significant thing that they now have entered the dialogue with fairly well rounded proposal said
