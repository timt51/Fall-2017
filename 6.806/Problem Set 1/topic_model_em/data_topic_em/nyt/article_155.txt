anthony dixon simple man the center complex debate can barely read write tests has consistently scored below the accepted cutoff that determines who mentally retarded was living group home for the retarded when fatally shot houston dentist and was sent texas death row although dixon case will not issue when the supreme court hears arguments next month whether ban the execution mentally retarded killers the court ruling likely will have direct effect him and untold number other death row inmates around the country when the court last ruled the matter cited lack national consensus against execution the mentally retarded and allowed continue but many legal scholars now believe the high court poised reverse itself and declare the practice unconstitutional the speculation fueled the efforts the court made take the issue this session and comments justice sandra day connor recently made questioning the fairness capital punishment there are more than people death row nationwide texas and nobody knows for sure how many are mentally retarded the houston chronicle has attempted answer that question least for harris county which sends more people death row than any other place the united states the paper contacted more than attorneys who participated the cases the people currently death row from harris county the paper reviewed trial accounts and appellate briefs determine the cases that might affected supreme court decision the paper found least seven men including dixon who arguably fit the clinically accepted definition mental retardation there could more and the supreme court bans executions the mentally retarded other defendants undoubtedly will raise the issue their appeals the seven inmates identified the chronicle are men with tested iqs that fall least points below which considered average men who they worked all while free held the most menial jobs men who failed mainstream courses children and were educated special education classes they bothered stay school all many cases they are men whose ability reason right from wrong already hampered their low intelligence was hindered further childhood abuse they are men convicted killing shopkeepers women children the supreme court decides unconstitutional execute the mentally retarded these men likely would some the first use the decision grounds request reprieves such court ruling would not automatically spare these men the execution chamber appellate prosecutors would have the right challenge the validity the tests introduce evidence these men are perhaps more intelligent than they appear and argue that they managed function other aspects society despite their low scores the standardized tests the possibly affected cases identified the chronicle dixon perhaps the most clearly defined still contentious dixon was student boarding school for the mentally retarded nacogdoches when was arrested for the murder elizabeth peavy the time dixon was adult under texas law with criminal record that included six felony convictions peavy was year old dentist who spent her free time leading youth group her church and providing free dental care the poor neighborhood clinics she was the middle three children family close they still meet sunday evenings for dinner their parents home bellaire was one these family dinners that beth her family called her was heading the day she died peavy spent the morning like she did nearly every sunday attending services cuthbert episcopal church she ate lunch with friends and then headed visit her parents she stopped kwik stop small convenience store and gas station across bissonnet from sharpstown high school there she crossed paths with anthony dixon dixon was his way play basketball with two guys from the apartment complex where his mother lived trial the men said dixon asked them let him out the car when saw peavy filling her year old red ford thunderbird with gas his confession dixon told police wanted the car but went about stealing unusual way instead jumping behind the wheel and speeding off when peavy left the driver door open and went inside pay dixon sat the curb and waited for her return met her the car and when she screamed shot her four times then ran back bissonnet but his friends had sped off when the shooting started dixon ran after them before returning peavy shooting her twice more pulling her body out the front seat and speeding away was arrested days later the nacogdoches youth home despite his enrollment school for the mentally retarded harris county prosecutors went after death sentence they presented evidence that dixon was higher than the test scores provided the defense indicated they also told jurors that had street smarts that are not measured tests karen hudgens was the jury that decided dixon fate the jury she said considered the evidence about dixon retardation and rejected that itself was not enough hudgens said even child that raised around guns knows they can kill knows you don the peavy family position executing the mentally retarded clear think the mentally retarded know right from wrong that just basic tenet said kathy peavy bailey the dead woman sister there are lot mentally retarded people who would not out and shoot someone mental retardation can caused many things genetic birth defects birth trauma head injuries lack oxygen toxic chemical reactions anything that can damage the central nervous system can cause mental retardation said houston forensic psychologist jerome brown down syndrome the most widely recognized form mental retardation because its distinguishing physical characteristics but not the most common the texas department mental health and mental retardation estimates that about percent the state population mentally retarded the national average between percent and percent according the american association mental retardation the aamr and other groups opposed executing the mentally retarded contend the punishment cruel and unusual because the mentally retarded have more difficulty reasoning discerning right from wrong fully understanding the consequences their actions than more intelligent criminal defendants lot mentally retarded people may know something right from wrong but they don know why said brown who has examined criminals during his year career when you don have that thinking harder control yourself when impulses come something wrong the mentally retarded are less likely overcome troubled childhoods brown said and they are more susceptible suggestions making them more likely confess crimes they did not commit according the aamr these are just some the reasons that many legal scholars believe the supreme court poised declare unconstitutional the execution the mentally retarded when considers the virginia case daryl atkins atkins was convicted murdering year old airman after robbing him for beer money reportedly has the supreme court was split when decided the texas case johnny paul penry that executing the mentally retarded was constitutional penry texas most famous mentally retarded death row inmate penry who has scored between and tests was convicted raping and murdering pamela moseley carpenter the east texas town livingston connor wrote the majority opinion the penry case although the court decided that juries should allowed consider defendant mental capacity when considering punishment also declared that national consensus had not developed against executing the mentally retarded the time only maryland and georgia had laws prohibiting such executions today the states that have death penalty statutes and the federal government ban the execution the mentally retarded chronicle poll conducted the fall found that percent harris county residents oppose putting mentally impaired murderers death the texas legislature last year passed law prohibiting such executions but the bill was vetoed gov rick perry who wanted the decision left jurors the supreme court made point take the issue this session originally the high court was hear the appeal mentally retarded man from north carolina who murdered cafeteria worker the case became moot when north carolina banned the execution the mentally retarded and the court agreed hear the atkins case its place further fueling the speculation among legal scholars are recent comments connor last summer while speaking attorneys minneapolis she questioned the fairness the death penalty and said statistics are any indication the system may well allowing some innocent defendants executed south texas college law professor neil mccabe said many believe the year old jurist has changed her mind the issue think she going retire soon she looking back what she done and not feeling all that good about she wants fix this one mccabe said she the vote would take she probably the swing vote possible the court will merely clarify its position executing the mentally retarded nothing more than reaffirm its previous position four justices can decide take case for the court but takes majority the nine members make ruling richard dieter executive director the death penalty information center said unlikely minority the court would take case knowing they would lose they going make statement one way another dieter said seems they want change some way among those eager see what the justices will are demetrius simms and the family year old monique miller simms was convicted murdering monique near north houston apartment complex simms was tried four times for the crime because the first three juries could not agree verdict simms scored test administered the time his arrest his competency was issue all four his trials this guy clearly retarded said defense attorney mike stone going execute year olds then that what this all about simms had lengthy criminal history that included conviction for the sexual assault year old boy chuck rosenthal now the harris county district attorney said was the criminal history that compelled him prosecute simms four times felt very strongly that demetrius simms did not get the death penalty that within years after preyed upon monique miller would out preying little girls again rosenthal said under current texas law people given life sentence for capital murder must serve least years before they are eligible for parole least five other local death penalty cases could touched the court ruling exzavier stevenson suffers from both low intelligence and mental illness stevenson was convicted shooting two convenience store clerks death

defense attorneys did not mention his second trial contacted recently the attorneys said they could not remember why les ribnik who representing richard his federal appeals was unaware richard had scored low test and this point has not raised appeal but ribnik said would the supreme court banned the execution the mentally retarded the law changes then could raise for the first time said marguerite dixon murder reiterates that the debate not limited courtrooms and legislatures can divide families too celeste dixon was when her mother was murdered now dixon opposed the death penalty and supports ban executing the mentally retarded somebody mentally retarded don think they can aware the full consequences their crime she said how can someone who has very limited mental capacity aware fully comprehend the consequences the crime don think the death penalty should apply that case but dixon one seven children one other joins her opposition the death penalty third has mixed
