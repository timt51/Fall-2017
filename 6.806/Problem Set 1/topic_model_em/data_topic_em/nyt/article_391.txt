san francisco resident bush pushing for new breed cars that run hydrogen fuel cells even though the technology for such vehicles does not yet exist and until does the nation will remain captive mideast oil interests but here the real kicker researchers the university california davis have already devised new and improved hybrid vehicle that runs both gas and electricity and nearly doubles average mileage however detroit far has rejected the concept largely for reasons economic self interest the davis team has been forced pitch its design overseas the japanese and south koreans are already expressing interest really unfortunate said andrew frank professor mechanical engineering and director the school hybrid electric vehicle center but either have give away the store let students starve have very little choice having taken decades regain semblance the domination ceded japan the 1970s the united states automobile industry once again danger missing out make break trend and have only ourselves blame you could say combination arrogance and stupidity well our short term thinking frank said all care about keeping shareholders happy don see the bigger picture the way they japan the japanese are leading the way with hybrid vehicle that runs gas but also generates electricity for increased fuel efficiency toyota and honda introduced such hybrids ford plans bring out japanese style hybrid next year what the davis researchers came with what they call plug hybrid different from the japanese approach that the plug runs either gas electricity depending driving conditions for city driving the plug would run solely electricity producing emissions whatsoever and offering range about miles after miles the vehicle tops mph highway the plug gas power kicks and runs like ordinary car recent study the electric power research institute palo alto think tank found that plug hybrids would cost consumers only about percent more than conventional gas powered vehicle the study also determined that plug hybrids would cut daily vehicle emissions half and slash petroleum consumption more than percent why hasn detroit embraced this nifty new technology frank said contacted general motors and offered equip one the automaker electricity only vehicles with hybrid capabilities took him the offer and received the converted prototype from davis year later frank said had high hopes that would recognize the benefits the hybrid system and bring out new line high tech super efficient vehicles didn happen time passed and time passed and eventually frank called last fall and asked what was going the automaker said had placed the hybrid storage and was preparing have destroyed basically the company says that customers won pay more for better fuel economy frank said think they just don want make changes their factories joseph lawrence spokesman told that the plug hybrid was rejected because the results the project never met our expectations whatever the reason sets the tone detroit and its abandonment plug hybrids deterred ford and daimlerchrysler from pursuing the technology although ford may having second thoughts detroit needs expand its thinking said bob graham who oversees transportation issues the electric power research institute said could take years develop the fuel cells bush envisions plug hybrids graham argued could interim technology that would address the united states environmental and oil dependency issues until fuel cells become viable alternative automakers are danger missing out very important trend said the fear among american researchers that the japanese and south koreans will bring out plug hybrids coming years and target them the asian and european markets where gas considerably more expensive than the united states once they become entrenched overseas the next beachhead course would the united states and then automakers would far behind that the cost trying compete would prohibitive davis frank trying optimistic even though the main source funding for his work the department defense dried soon the bush administration took over been going around the world making presentations said suspicion that toyota and honda already have something cooking their back rooms how many times does this have happen before learn our lesson
