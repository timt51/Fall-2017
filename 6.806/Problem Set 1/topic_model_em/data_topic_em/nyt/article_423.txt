barnett kramer has never shied away from the seemingly impossible clinical trial when some people said the national cancer institute could never investigate the benefits established screening tests for prostate colon cancer because patients would never agree such investigation the institute proved the skeptics wrong kramer advocated investigation the tests benefits and with little trouble the cancer institute where works senior scientist found tens thousands people willing have their screening decisions made random even though for many meant that they had forgo tests like the psa for prostate cancer and the sigmoidoscopy for colon cancer what considered the gold standard scientific evidence gathering randomized controlled clinical trial some people are having the potentially lifesaving screening tests and some are not independent monitoring committee standing see the cancer death rate one group exceeds that the other that point the study will end but when comes mammograms even kramer gives yes says would way out the current situation dispute over whether old studies mammograms show any benefit for the screening test new randomized and controlled study done with today standards could provide more convincing data has interest proposing neither others they say they cannot imagine finding tens thousands women agnostic about the value mammograms that they would agree let this screening decision made the figurative toss coin almost women are indifferent about mammograms said donald berry chairman the department biostatistics the anderson cancer center houston most women want mammograms few don the number who are indifferent they would willing randomized very very small kramer said never like say impossible but the would very very difficult new randomized mammography trial now experts start agonizing debate over the value mammograms they are faced with few options some are trying tease answers out national data breast cancer death rates over the past half century others are calling for audit the old trials going over the raw data detail and even scrutinizing participants medical records one thinks that either these patchwork solutions will quick easy universally accepted behind the dueling experts are some grim facts about this screening test one that means obvious that early detection breast cancer best that would only there was window time when treatment made difference and that window coincided with the time when tumor could found only with mammogram but what mammography already too late for some cancers tumor has more than billion cells the time even mammogram can see what the window starts later like testicular cancer which early detection makes difference late and early stage testicular cancers are equally curable whatever its benefits most experts agree that there downside mammography can result some women getting surgery and medical treatment for cancers that might might treated just effectively years later and some women may treated for conditions that might never have turned into life threatening cancers the question whether there are benefits that outweigh the risks breast cancer accounts for percent percent deaths among women even with the most optimistic estimate mammography benefits woman who had mammograms every year starting age would much for her life expectancy she would losing five ounces fat and keeping off berry calculates still with the mammography disputes raging and with few other options determine whether the test effective berry and researchers five other medical centers are collaborating find out why breast cancer death rates are declining around the rates started drop drastically about percent year the question why radiologists say because mammograms berry said noting that the screening test was coming into widespread use the end the 1980s but medical oncologists went point improved treatment particular tamoxifen which can sharply decrease the death rate from breast cancer the drug was first prescribed for postmenopausal breast cancer patients the end the 1980s five years later when doctors realized worked just well for younger women they began getting too the drug works breast cancers whose growth fueled estrogen preventing the hormone from reaching them and women with these estrogen sensitive cancers can decrease the breast cancer death rate percent berry said said the effect was extraordinary because these are women who are high risk dying from the disease treatment that slashes their death rate can make huge dent mortality statistics berry said the researchers would try explain the declining death rates see they can determine whether tamoxifen mammography both can account for those decreases they will relying data from the national cancer institute and the centers for disease control and prevention the use mammography healthy women and tamoxifen women with breast cancer the 1990s berry said was far from ideal way answer the mammography question but considering the circumstances said may the best anyone can still looming however are unanswered questions about the original seven mammography studies that were done decades past experts disagree about whether those questions including how comparable the screened group was the unscreened group are troubling enough cast doubt the conclusions that mammograms prevent breast cancer deaths such questions might resolved investigators could audit the original study data berry said going take lot effort carefully sift through this said suzanne fletcher harvard medical school but lot less effort than start over
