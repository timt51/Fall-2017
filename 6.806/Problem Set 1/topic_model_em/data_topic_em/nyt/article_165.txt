jane kay san francisco chronicle san franciscio one would expect the progressive bay area home the sierra club and the silicon valley embrace the latest high tech environmentally friendly public transit but the opposite has happened los angeles san diego and sacramento began convert their bus fleets natural gas electricity cut air pollution bay area transit operators led the lobbying keep statewide option buy diesel buses into under what has come known the bay area exemption the region transit agencies have chosen stick with diesel which experts say responsible for the biggest cancer risk from air pollution talk about being embarrassed said julia levin attorney with the union concerned scientists fresno was more progressive than san francisco chose the alternative fuel path and not the diesel san francisco municipal railway transit golden gate transit and others argue that changing alternative technologies too expensive and they say diesel buses can made just clean using upgraded engines new pollution control devices and low sulfur fuel but the transit agencies loyal diesel have not convinced regulators that they can cut emissions schedule now the state air resources board thinking about rescinding the diesel choice march will vote whether require all agencies buy only natural gas and other alternative fuel buses issue the battle over transit buses reducing the worst source air pollution diesel exhaust from all sources mostly trucks and buses accounts for percent the cancer risk from air pollution health officials estimate that diesel emissions will cause californians develop cancer addition nitrogen oxide from diesel trucks and buses also prime ingredient smog which has been linked with respiratory illnesses last month university california los aangeles study correlated smog with increased birth defects los angeles and stanford university researchers concluded that diesel exhaust was the leading cause global warming after carbon dioxide urban transit authorities are often the first switch less polluting technologies because the agencies are publicly funded and because easier and more cost effective convert fleets with central refueling operations originally when the air board was considering the new rule for transit bus fleets february was going require most large agencies stop buying diesel buses completely and use the cleaner compressed liquefied natural gas buses instead ultimately transit agencies would have convert buses powered hydrogen fuel cells the top the line environmentalists and southern california air quality officials pressed for diesel ban saying the alternative technologies had proven track records los angeles and around the country the natural gas buses cost more than diesel bus but grants help make the difference the diesel buses the roads today are extremely dirty and toxic these are the buses that penetrate our neighborhoods said todd campbell policy director the coalition for clean air los angeles who lobbied for ban they take our children and from school they come contact with transit riders bicyclists pedestrians and people passenger cars really affects our quality life and our health until the diesel industry gets serious decide give them our life risk but some transit operators along with engine manufacturers and oil companies lobbied retain the option buying new diesel buses charles kalb purchasing manager transit which serves alameda county said made economic sense convert its infrastructure from diesel natural gas the end was going convert again fuel cells makes more sense said stick with diesel and then switch fuel cells costs lot money switch natural gas kalb said not only fuel more costly but maintenance more expensive the engines don seem last long you have spend lot money rehabilitating maintenance facilities accommodate natural gas besides transit operators argued diesel could made just clean natural gas new diesel engines that burn fuel that lower sulfur would cut nitrogen oxide and other harmful emissions and better pollution control devices would take more the deadly particulates out exhaust after the four days hearings february the board compromised allowing transit agencies choose diesel path well alternative fuel option many credited the lobbying efforts the influential bay area operators the bay area only sonoma county transit and union city transit chose the alternative fuel option contrast the transit agencies the los angeles area and five six agencies the san diego area have switched alternative fuel buses currently percent the bay area bus fleet diesel compared with percent los angeles and percent sacramento muni the biggest bay area bus company picked the diesel path with electric trolleys dating from the 1930s and diesel buses just bought its first alternative fuel buses last year san francisco supervisor tom ammiano said the supervisors have been trying get muni buy natural gas buses for years muni delayed was very frustrating said last year the supervisors negotiated with muni and environmental groups buy the natural gas buses eventually won have any diesel buses this great step forward for clean air and good health can see the city that love ammiano said walt streeter muni deputy general manager admitted the transit agency took lot criticism for waiting long muni could not raise the state and federal funds buy the natural gas buses said but muni defends the diesel path just clean the alternative fuel path levin the union concerned scientists said that because muni dragged its feet natural gas buses ended buying diesel buses last year muni had purchased the same number natural gas buses would have reduced toxic particulate matter tons which equivalent removing cars off san francisco roads over years she said under the transit bus rule the agencies that chose the diesel path had meet certain conditions including submitting blueprint how they will curtail diesel pollution now nearly two years after the rule passed most the agencies have failed come with such plans also the diesel industry has revealed that cannot produce the promised upgraded engines and there are exhaust control devices for california buses made and earlier leaving the aging buses belching particulates then october the manufacturers announced that they did not intend come through with the called ultra clean diesel buses required jed mandel general counsel for the engine manufacturers association said the industry having hard time dealing with state rule that tougher than the federal rule the diesel industry cannot spend the research and development money come with better bus just meet the california deadline mandel said would have cost millions dollars for couple hundred engines said furthermore said pam jones spokeswoman for the industry diesel technology forum the exhaust control equipment for older buses available but the state has been slow verifying its effectiveness for california any event some members the state air resources board felt betrayed after agreed continuing with diesel for the benefit the manufacturers and the operators the tune changed said mark desaulnier the contra costa county supervisor who represents the bay area the board they said don think can desaulnier one many the member board who openly criticized the engine manufacturers the bay area operators and some other regions for not taking the transit bus rule seriously worked real hard for there diesel path and just disgusted what see here said matt mckinnon sacramento board member representing the public nobody wants work with the diesel path maybe need not have one
