with each passing year new discoveries earth bolster the possibility life outside our planet its january issue the journal nature reported the discovery population microbes found deep inside earth population far removed from any source sunlight any other influx organic materials these hardy bugs methanogenic archaea have taste for hydrogen fuel their teeny systems they have absolutely need for sunlight any other source food other than the gas which escapes from geothermal activity almost every other living system earth needs least some energy provided the sun sunlight drives photosynthesis the process used plants produce food from the reaction sunlight with chlorophyll the stuff that makes leaf green almost all living systems earth depend variations photosynthesis either directly plants indirectly creatures that eat plants the underground microbes found feet below the surface idaho are ancient form bacteria that can survive without energy from the sun and feed off non organic materials setting them apart from all other forms life earth the conditions that archaea have come find homey deep the idaho soil are conditions that are seen repeatedly throughout the solar system about million years ago water from deep within the earth bubbled into layers volcanic ash laid down eruptions mount kilgore idaho the reaction heated the ash such extreme temperatures that left behind volcanic tuff devoid all organic materials these conditions are echoed the layers martian soil even though the viking probes have shown that there not enough organic material mars sustain life commonly know the red planet might still home creatures such the archaea the idaho discovery also raises the possibility life europa and callisto two jupiter galilean moons these moons are thought harbor huge salty oceans just under their thick crusts ice although scientists believe these oceans may sterile without the organic material needed support ecosystem since they need neither organic material nor sunlight survive archaea cast doubt the notion that these oceans must lifeless archaea prove that life will find way survive even the harsh outskirts what man considers habitable needing only water hydrogen and carbon dioxide three common elements throughout the entire solar system methanogenic archaea may indeed the very first extraterrestrials man encounters during full explorations mars and beyond michael alicea writes for the palm beach post you may contact him michaelalicea pbpost com story filed cox newspapers
