new england fabled cod and haddock along with many other fish species will all but disappear within decade from the north atlantic drastic measures aren taken stop overfishing according one the most comprehensive reviews fishing ever conducted while some new england fish species seem increasing numbers the report funded the pew charitable trusts and released saturday boston said their recovery not telling the whole story north atlantic fish stocks are depleted that there are barely enough mature fish produce another generation the collapse fish populations occurring said the study because the population fish that people eat continues decrease while commercial fishing continues rise the north atlantic has about one sixth the number fish had and being fished eight times intensively scientists say fishermen are also chasing species ever lower the food chain bigger fish are depleted with few exceptions are going lose most fisheries the next decade don quickly mend our ways said daniel pauly university british columbia scientist who headed the study the group announced its results the annual meeting the american association for the advancement science may sound like doomsday scenario but the decline actually accelerating even where stocks are doing better they are still hovering the bottom pit pauly said the group scientists and about consultants undertook the year analysis after becoming frustrated the lack any oceanwide fisheries information the group composed fishery scientists biologists and economists from research institutions europe and north america most researchers and regulators tend focus only one species geographical area and little the information has been pieced together the scientists however did just that synthesizing millions numbers regarding fish species catches and populations over generations come with model the north atlantic while the scientists not have any power make policy their study expected weigh heavily with regulators decisions are made coming months further protect new england fish their proposed solutions are sure considered drastic many fishermen thousands square miles set aside take zones where fish are protected bears are national park large reductions fishing fleets and abolition most subsidies industrial fishing fleets fishermen many whom say stocks aren nearly imperiled scientists claim have faced increasing restrictions the last seven years regulators attempt rebuild scallop flounder and other species off new england patchwork closures limited fishing days and fishing gear that let more fish escape are now place just the last year the effort seemed pay off with the opening some scallop beds and cod plentiful lobstermen were pulling them traps unbelievable suggest the stocks are about vanish said david bergeron coordinator the massachusetts fishermen partnership association state fishing groups there are more fish out there now than there has been generation already have many closures areas fishing how many more they want once fishing off new england coast was the stuff legend georges bank ancient submerged island was considered one the most important fishing areas the world cod haddock herring clams and lobsters thrived there europeans came massachusetts part for the cod and until the 1990s the supply seemed limitless but overfishing led one fishery after another the 1990s being declared exhausted after cod and haddock were fished out fishermen began harvesting trash fish they used throw away such the spiny dogfish britain created hot market for that whitefish using fish and chip dinners soon however those stocks also collapsed and federal regulators came under fire for not doing their job help all fish populations recovery last month district judge gladys kessler ruled regulators weren doing enough prevent overfishing finding that could lead further restrictions authors the new study echoed the judge saying regulators have largely failed prevent overfishing large part because they looked fishing problem individual species not oceanwide one that essentially moving around the deck chairs the titanic said andy rosenberg university new hampshire dean who spearheaded the partial fishing closures georges bank when worked for the national marine fisheries services the last years the catch popular fish species such cod tuna and haddock has decreased more than half despite tripling fishing across the north atlantic the study found not just that there are more boats sophisticated technology also makes the fish easier catch countries spend billion taxpayer money each year search out the last fish left the north atlantic said rashid sumaila the michelsen institute norway who conducted economic analysis part the study the same time fish gets more expensive every year noted seafood prices especially for lobsters and shrimp have increased fold since new englanders can continue eat their favorite fish because much the seafood imported from developing countries practice that the scientists said should not allowed continue the national marine fisheries service one the prime regulators fishermen declined comment the report saying had not yet seen however mike sissenwine director the agency northeast fishery science center agreed regulators usually have not pushed for more stringent fishing restrictions because economic and social backlash from fishing communities the scientists saturday said regulators must ignore political and social pressure and what best for the ocean they suggest that most incentives and government aid for fishermen whether break fuel tax money for new boats abolished but the idea creating large protected areas the ocean that will upset fishermen most while the report scientists were unsure how large the take zones should they agreed each needed several thousand square miles effective just like creating park said rosenberg the areas have large you can get vibrant habitat that just the reality while closures exist the gulf maine and georges bank the scientists said they are too small worldwide less than percent ocean waters have such protection according the conservation law foundation that group and others recently conducted poll that found percent new englanders support protected zones but pauly said that such closures work only done tandem with reductions fishing pressure and warned against the urge reopen closed areas after stocks make initial recoveries rebuild again reopen and then fish again said pauly for example said while new england cod stocks are larger than they were years ago they are still dramatically lower than the 1960s you may think are making headway with few individual stocks but overall are unequivocally losing the battle manage fisheries the north atlantic said pauly the problem profound ocean wide level beth daley can reached bdaley globe com
