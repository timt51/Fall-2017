engineers have yet create tiny submarine like the one the movie fantastic voyage which traveled through patient bloodstream battle deadly blood clot but researchers are steadily shrinking once massive machines fabricating blades hinges and other parts out silicon ever tinier scale create systems the size grain sand red blood cell millions these miniature machines known microelectromechanical systems mems may surround one day embedded the concrete foundations roads and bridges monitor their conditions aloft check for biological warfare agents the atmosphere attached automobile tires gauge pressure their job far from wall outlet mems devices need power sense calculate and transmit the data they collect but far the batteries needed accomplish that have not duplicated the amazing shrinking act the silicon machines the power battery depends its volume and scaling down the size while maintaining the power has proved tremendous challenge address the problem handful researchers have turned from traditional fossil fuels electrochemical cells new source create micro and nano size batteries nuclear power the hope that the high energy particles emitted radioactive materials they decay will one day drive generation mems devices james blanchard associate professor nuclear engineering the university wisconsin madison has spent the last three years and about awarded the department energy develop prototypes nuclear microbatteries for mems use blanchard not splitting atoms get his nanonukes which the first thing has learned explain patiently when describing his work people hear nuclear and power and they think fission and explosions said that not what are doing are not splitting uranium instead blanchard and university colleague and mems expert amit lal are using minute amounts radioactive version nickel nickel one the prototypes they have developed this substance decays produces beta particles high energy electrons that now yield nanowatts one nanowatt one billionth watt and may soon the inventors hope yield microwatts this kind technology harnessing radioactive isotopes create power source was used create the far larger nuclear batteries nasa cassini probe launched help travel through the far reaches space shrinking such technology became blanchard goal wanted show could done said resigned alarmed reactions the mention the word nuclear blanchard quick explain how little nuclear material involved batteries headed for another planet make few hundred watts using isotope plutonium and are the size dishwasher said ours about dangerous smoke detector that falls off the wall and breaks smoke detectors contain small amounts radioactive materials one blanchard prototypes nickel dissolved solution poured into micromachined channels another travels pyramid shape indentations the silicon the relatively low energy emitted beta particles does not damage the semiconductor device where the particles collect the half life the isotope years meaning that that time half the substance will have decayed makes attractive for long term applications blanchard group has also worked with alpha emitting radioisotopes and plans use them for future experiments his work microbatteries was reported last april the ninth international conference nuclear engineering nice france jean pierre fleurial physicist the jet propulsion laboratory pasadena calif oversees several projects that tap the power alpha particles including effort the university illinois alpha particles give off far more energy than beta particles and are therefore promising source said but some prototypes they eventually damage the semiconductor diode where they are collected and converted electricity the work ahead find innovative designs that last long time and are reasonably efficient fleurial said because the research has already yielded several prototypes said confident that alpha particles will eventually yield powerful batteries most the power source technologies don scale down easily explained these the work fleurial and his colleagues was reported last june the 20th international conference thermoelectrics beijing kris pister professor the university california berkeley among the scientists who aim give microbatteries trial run with wireless network based mems technology pister the inventor smart dust networked airborne motes silicon that are designed sense measure and transmit data like temperature humidity and light intensity everything getting smaller mems but the batteries said the batteries remain the single heaviest and most expensive part pister said was considering making smart dust that draws its power from the radioactive isotope tritium and that had been approached trace photonics company charleston ill that interested shrinking nuclear batteries smart dust size nuclear batteries can potentially give off staggering amount energy said their longevity also makes them attractive many applications wireless networks are for places you never want back pister said like the foundations tall buildings the walls houses you don want have dig beneath the sheetrock change the batteries what risks might the batteries pose for instance they were scattered through the walls large building monitor air quality temperature they aren likely very dangerous said stephen schwartz publisher the bulletin the atomic scientists unless you ate them threw them the fire and inhaled the smoke most people are still unaware that their smoke detectors contain radioactive materials schwartz said still added people did become aware that mems devices might powered nuclear batteries some them might alarmed the odds getting hurt these devices would very small but research them should not kept secret said let people know about the work said let all the facts put the table and then let people decide
