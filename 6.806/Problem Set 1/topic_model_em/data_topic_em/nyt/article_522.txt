washington tri cities butterfly sensitive cold has recently gained foothold michigan upper peninsula birds are returning from their winter migrations earlier the spring the eastern seaboard cape may warbler has shifted its range the north and the trend continues century there will more baltimore orioles baltimore these are just few examples from wide ranging new analysis dozens scientific studies that suggests global warming already has been felt plants and wild animals authored two noted climate change researchers the analysis formed the basis the wildlife effects portion the most recent scientific evaluation the intergovernmental panel climate change the group put together the united nations and the world meteorological organization drew the work more than the world leading climate scientists the part the ipcc report documenting effects the warming world wildlife and plants has now been fleshed out report just issued the national wildlife federation are already seeing discernible impact wildlife and plants said terry root the university michigan author the analysis with stephen schneider stanford university there are going dramatic effects the release the report came president bush prepares his response global warming climate change with its potential impact every corner the world issue that must addressed the world bush said last june but preview his announcement thursday bush council economic advisors recently questioned the need for urgent action that would force cutbacks the use gasoline and other carbon based fuels mark van putten president the national wildlife federation said the group contracted with root and schneider guide younger scientists examining effects climate change and expound root work for the ipcc the relationship between animals and plants which have developed over thousands years are being altered van putten said wildlife like the canaries the mine the overwhelming evidence that already seeing impacts the question what are going about root surveyed hundreds scientific studies that seemed have some bearing whether wildlife plants were affected climate among them she found covering animal species and plant species across four continents that appeared point those species about showed the kinds responses that would expected warming world such birds laying eggs earlier the spring and butterflies expanding their ranges the north what about the species that didn respond expected you took coin and flipped and whatever times and came heads and some times you say you have weighted coin root said not possible say with absolute certainty that global warming caused the different behavior the plants and animals she said but sure looks that way the changes happened the average global climate warmed only little compared the amount expected warm coming decades she noted kind like circumstantial evidence root said you never have the smoking gun but you add the evidence you can say there very high probability that this what going scientists who study the earth climate are wide agreement that the planet warming and will continue for hundreds years there much less certainty about the rate which the atmosphere will warm and when that will stop much the uncertainty stems from not knowing when people will able replace technology such cars and power plants that burn carbon based fuels whose byproducts trap heat the atmosphere root work was reviewed extensively other climate scientists and later representatives governments who grilled her for two days those governments including representatives the united states signed off her study release the report came about the same time the world wildlife federation released another study predicting that biologically rich regions the world are likely experience negative effects among the other results predicted was the disappearance the rain forests washington olympic peninsula however the wwf study was based computer models that produce best guess possibilities based imperfect knowledge climate dynamics root work based impacts that already have been measured was released conjunction with another study then university washington researcher lisa crozier who examined the appearance the sachem skipper butterfly the tri cities beginning the early 1990s crozier wanted see the butterfly arrival was caused warming climate typically southern species the butterfly seems limited range cold winter temperatures that kill their caterpillars she found through field experiments the caterpillars managed struggle through the winter the tri cities but died yakima which has winter temperatures approximating those the tri cities about years ago crozier said crozier said she did many studies rule out other possible causes and think this really good evidence that they couldn have survived the tri cities before the recent warming another study released conjunction with crozier documented the growing abundance sea creatures that are favored warm ocean water california monterey bay and the decrease species favored cold water some the scientific work covered root analysis showed that the range some warblers including the black footed gray warbler washington moving north jeff price ornithologist with the american bird conservancy who studied the warblers said the potential impacts could far reaching for example said several eastern warblers specialize eating spruce budworms which are prickly insects shunned most birds the warblers have special mucus that makes the bugs edible for them forests abandoned the warblers their range moves north scientists theorize the budworms are likely get out control among the effects price believes could higher prices for products such timber and christmas trees
