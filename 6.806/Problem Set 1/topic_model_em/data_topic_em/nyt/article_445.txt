while the majority baby boomers and generation xers seem for japanese and european cars when they are shopping for affordable compact there solid entry the class from general motors that sets sales records just about every year the pontiac grand one america best selling compact cars for several years running built the same vehicle platform the chevrolet malibu and oldsmobile alero the grand perennially outsells both those probably because combination sporty styling good performance and great price this car delivers whole lot value with prices starting just for well equipped coupe and for the sedan plus transportation general motors discount available for the pontiac when you compare that with the two most popular import compacts with similar equipment packages the honda civic and the volkswagen jetta you find that the pontiac least equal not lower price yet larger and roomier fact the grand really almost big some the most popular midsize sedans such the toyota camry and honda accord you comparing apples apples better compare the grand those cars there more rear seat leg and knee room the grand se1 coupe than the lexus sedan amazingly the grand sedan and coupe have almost identical measurements including ample backseat space and even their exterior styling and interior appointments are almost indistinguishable from each other except for the two doors the coupe the four doors the sedan creating the coupe pontiac just eliminated the rear doors and made the front doors wider almost everything else the same befitting its status pontiac one general motors midlevel brands the grand comes with load standard equipment that puts the verge being luxury car our se1 coupe base price plus transportation which next the bottom the line the the entry level model came with amenities that would expect find only cars that cost lot more standard even the base model are antilock brakes air conditioning automatic headlights programmable automatic locking doors rear window defogger and wiper fog lights rear decklid spoiler tilt steering wheel illuminated entry tachometer compact disc stereo carpeted front and rear floormats electric remote trunk release battery rundown

for just more solid value options package list price discounted tacked bunch more including power glass sunroof inch chrome aluminum wheels and the upgraded monsoon audio system with eight speakers and built and cassette decks the base transmission five speed manual but our car came with the optional four speed automatic which added the price with that our sticker totaled including transportation the grand rides very comfortable four wheel independent suspension and even though there great ride the suspension stiff enough allow for decent road handling upgrading the grand version adds even better sport suspension but takes some the ride softness away the base engine for the model new liter inline four cylinder rated horsepower and foot pounds torque our feeling was that the four cylinder our test car felt like there was ample power for passing and freeway merging but you can upgrade liter engine the se1 model for bringing horsepower and foot pounds torque with ram air induction available the top the line sporty model which adds five horsepower and foot pounds torque models start for the coupe and for the sedan the four cylinder used the models has less horsepower than the liter four cylinder used the models but didn notice any difference significant other drives grand se1 sedan very familiar with these cars both years seem have plenty power and actually had open the hood and check make sure the test car had the four cylinder drove like like the grand styling including the body side cladding that some folks designers daimlerchrysler like make fun adds lot the look the car without substantially increasing production costs even the trunk the grand roomy for what billed compact cubic feet much more than you find most midsize cars fuel economy one the grand strongest points our test vehicle was rated miles per gallon the city and truly impressive mpg the highway which fantastic for car with automatic transmission and this much zip gauges and controls the dashboard and console are well placed and easy read operate helping make the entire interior very user friendly what about reliability problems there either these are long lasting serviceable cars that give minimum trouble can vouch for that from our own experience but the grand wouldn popular other people weren having the same good experience with the bottom line here that you really don have follow the crowd and buy import you are looking for affordable yet well equipped family sedan general motors has one that can hold its own with the best those sedans from japan and germany
