advising sayed jaffar warlord the northern alliance whose forces helped push the taliban out the northern city kunduz the town fell nov but the region was still dangerous and now the nearby village pul kumri erupted gunfire the jaffar militia confronted the troops another anti taliban warlord was the kind violence that for years had hampered the resistance seeing military logic refereeing this dispute american commanders rushed combat talon transport plane and two black hawk helicopters extract the special forces from the scene for good measure gunship bristling with rapid fire cannons covered their extraction american special operations forces afghanistan whose experiences are reshaping war fighting doctrine faced many obstacles foul weather strange allies friendly fire and course the enemy and many the military were surprised how much they had accomplished even the war entered new phase with the first use american ground troops late october senior commanders were unsure that sending few dozen advisers into the fight could topple the taliban and cripple qaida they were ready throw much larger numbers conventional troops into combat the ground campaign opened one the darkest nights the war four days past new moon and when the sun rose the next morning oct two very different operations had been completed illustrate the choice methods that the pentagon was considering but the pentagon the time spoke publicly about only one the operations that occurred that night just hours after the mission ended the pentagon announced that hundreds army rangers had parachuted onto military airfield about miles south kandahar while helicopter raid hit taliban compound the edge the city dramatic videotape the airborne assault was broadcast but the pentagon said nothing for several days about secret ground war which quickly became the real ground war that started simultaneously the north the first two teams army special forces the division known the green berets infiltrate afghanistan landed helicopter that same night according special forces commanders who planned the mission one joined with abdul rashid dostum the war calloused northern alliance commander near mazar sharif and the other with muhammad fahim khan now afghan defense minister whose forces were then loosely arrayed against the taliban the direction kabul more would follow but was not easy during just the second mission carry special forces teams into the north the helicopters were unable land because powerful sandstorm cannot even begin describe the frustrations senior commander recalled were right there was like just six more inches but couldn get over the goal line but just three weeks those teams the special forces calls the detachments dozen select troops transformed the northern alliance into force capable routing the taliban army which was increasingly damaged and demoralized the more precise bombing that the american target spotters made possible few things surprised the pentagon and its commanders much how rapidly the military picture changed with the arrival the special forces the prospect fighting big battles with american troops faded away brig gen richard comer deputy commander the air force special operations command hurlburt field fla said the more conventional plan had been put large amount american forces hop them air the alternative comer said was rely mainly the native forces opposing the taliban the thinking said was let start with that see what they can put special forces there knit them together and see how good can make had not worked the war might have seen many strikes relatively large forces rangers and other infantry units final push marines were seize kandahar international airport force senior officials said reasonably expected lot more heavy operations senior defense department official said might have seen more those events like rangers dropping out the sky given night but the teams brought steady increase pressure and the sudden collapse the taliban nobody predicted that the lessons from the afghan experience already are being adopted the broader war against international terrorism the philippines scores special forces are being sent advise and assist manila army fighting terrorists the pentagon war rooms contingency plans for future operations are being examined and top officers are declaring that relatively small but highly proficient units operating secretively and equipped with arsenal all their own can quickly change the balance power but the war afghanistan has illuminated the risks well special operations forces had help quell riot when taliban prisoners rebelled killing cia officer helicopter that crashed the mountains trying evacuate sick commando had bombed american jet protect its secret equipment errant bomb killed three americans the special forces and nearly killed hamid karzai the day was appointed head the new interim afghan government and the only soldier killed far hostile fire was sgt 1st class nathan ross chapman the special forces his group was ambushed paktia while trying stitch together afghan militia hunt for osama bin laden and his taliban ally mullah muhammad omar that mission still has not been accomplished first ranger mission meticulous planning for the first use american ground forces the war began late september after the pentagon learned remote desert airfield within striking distance kandahar fort benning intelligence officers the 75th ranger regiment pored over photographs from satellites predator drones and other reconnaissance aircraft they calculated the height wall around the compound from the length its shadow pinpointed potential stinger missile placements and closely watched the movements construction workers and taliban troops overnight oct four combat talon airlifters dropped more than army rangers the airstrip code named objective rhino would month before american forces marines would return that base and when they did their role was largely protect that special operations forces would have staging point near kandahar the rangers shot and killed fleeing taliban soldier scoured the empty compound for weapons and collected some documents few which proved useful american warplanes killed another taliban near the airstrip was meat and potatoes ranger mission said maj robert whalen intelligence officer the 75th ranger regiment seize the airfield lighting fast strike and get out for most the rangers mainly their early 20s was their first combat mission the way into afghanistan from their staging area the persian gulf staff sgt timothy shrewsbury recalled battalion commander led the soldiers reciting the ranger creed surrender not ranger word says part will never leave fallen comrade fall into the hands the enemy know wasn scared shrewsbury said such cliche but the training really does take over was like big exercise though smaller groups rangers would conduct other missions southern afghanistan mainly calling airstrikes against convoys the first commando raid the war was not repeated unconventional war the use small highly trained units accomplish large strategic missions exploiting enemy weakness has been talked about for years but tried with mixed success the past initially there was little reason optimistic about fighting this kind war the anarchy afghanistan army special forces typically take months not years cultivate relationships with friendly regional powers the term special forces refers the army green berets only the phrase special operations forces encompasses the unconventional warriors all branches the military while special forces had trained with some central asian militaries they had never worked with afghans whose hostility foreign armies goes back generations before the war the mission attacking bin laden and his supporters and bolstering the anti taliban resistance belonged the central intelligence agency the extent which the special forces worked with the cia was another novelty this war have more access more junior level important intelligence than ever before army special forces commander said what are giving our teams the field much more than they gotten before the past there was lot information that was not given captains and the teams this time they got the first question was whom help and took weeks answer basically had figure out who was bad bad guy who was bad good guy and there were any good good guys the officer said the north they chose from commanders who had kept their armies intact after the taliban gained control the cities the south they looked for tribal leaders who could attract fighters their side from the mainly pashtun tribal groups one such leader was karzai who infiltrated afghanistan from pakistan believed had the most loyal following but they weren soldiers said special forces lieutenant colonel named dave who commands the teams that linked with karzai outside kandahar providing security and military advice his forces they were shopkeepers and farmers and friends said dave who like many the unconventional warriors spoke condition that his last name withheld they would advance the front toyota pickup trucks and subaru taxis getting uniforms ammunition and food those forces took time but with american advisers their sides they took the offensive quickly and with the special forces designating the targets the front lines the intense bombardment from the sky gave the anti taliban forces the ultimate advantage air operations calling airstrikes one the most important jobs given special operations forces when some taliban prisoners rebelled inside 19th century fortress near mazar sharif late november one the first troops rush the scene was year old air force combat controller staff sergeant named mike eight year veteran from oxford conn the sergeant said pinpointed enemy positions and radioed for airstrikes navy 18s carrying pound bombs took them just minutes respond one the satellite guided bombs exploded only feet from his position hurling him into the air and wounding four other american troops everything went black and thought was dead said interview hurlburt field where recovering from punctured ear drums flash burns his face and scratched corneas was one about combat controllers weathermen and search and rescue specialists then operating afghanistan officials said trained scout targets and spot them with laser range finders combat controllers also advise pilots what kind bomb drop and how best fly the target they also identify landing zones for troops and drop zones for parachute borne supplies each the controllers carries pounds gear including radio and navigation equipment and course rifle the steep mountain trails afghanistan presented challenges mike saidd trained for lot but this was the first time ever rode horseback said bold new missions while the use special forces build opposition army afghanistan was straight from the doctrine unconventional warfare their wholesale integration into the air war was unusual according senior military officials involved planning throughout the conflict the guys the ground were originally conceived developing classic liaison relationships with local forces with the goal being build groundswell opposition senior military officer said said this strategic plan became more tactical the special forces teams proved effective spotting targets for american bombers and attack jets refocused our efforts the officer said did not expect they would play such large tactical role but the path had been blazed advance last july gen maxwell bailey who until earlier this month was head the air force special operations command created permanent special operations liaison team ready deploy short notice any regional conflict twelve days after the attacks the world trade center and pentagon sept two dozen its air force experts and three army green berets arrived prince sultan air base outside riyadh saudi arabia join the planning for the air war that started two weeks later the team first job was manage the flow special operations search and rescue helicopters army 47s and air force 53s into pakistan and uzbekistan from forward base oman the persian gulf air force special operations command planes also flew some the most devastating attack missions the cargo plane choice the combat talon equipped with advanced terrain following and terrain avoidance radar also used drop the pound blu daisy cutter bombs the combat talons flying hour round trip missions from their base incirlik turkey also parachuted hundreds plywood containers each weighing pounds and filled with food winter clothing and small arms the anti taliban forces who would carry the brunt the fighting rapid deployment dec three green berets and five their afghan comrades were killed when they were struck errant american bomb during the siege kandahar many more were wounded fresh special forces team code named python was given just minutes grab weapons and packs and load onto for the flight the marines forward base camp rhino even before they touched down the desert airstrip transport helicopter and two attack helicopters had their rotors spinning for the trip the front there was none the army hurry and wait that day said randy sergeant first class and the python combat medicine specialist they arrived just hours after the fratricidal bombing and the offensive kandahar continued there are many visible reminders what happened maj don deputy commander special forces the kandahar region still limps from wounds received dec but refused leave afghanistan and the men python still drive white truck its windshield blown out and its panels pocked shrapnel from the errant bombing and some are less visible one night just outside kandahar member python produced armful mail from his pack had just heard how the remains one green beret were taken home with letter from his wife still his pocket don make home don want these letters coming home with personal effects said pitched fistful holiday cards and notes into the roaring campfire the python base came the compound where mullah omar once ruled lesson learned command and control for years the pentagon has struggled blend special operations forces with their distinctive training their peculiar weaponry their unorthodox tactics and their culture secrecy into the joint operations land sea and air forces the afghanistan campaign this was goal from the start unconventional warriors have their own unified combatant commander gen charles holland who heads the special operations command socom the umbrella command that encompasses the unconventional forces from all services among the distinctions his command the only one the military with its own research and development budget but holland played much larger role the afghan campaign than simply readying and providing those forces combat his units came under the command gen tommy franks the commander chief the central command centcom who charge all military operations from the horn africa the hindu kush subordinate him rear adm albert calland iii commander centsoc the special operations command the region complicated chain command anathema warriors but the day day reality this arrangement was not complex franks headquarters tampa fla literally next door the headquarters the special operations command and holland speak virtually every day and planned the war together their civilian boss defense secretary donald rumsfeld likes joke that hates say things twice franks and gen richard myers chairman the joint chiefs staff speak all together least twice day discuss jointly all aspects the war campaign the war was unpredictable any other but there little sign that the commanders struggled over the use unconventional forces but the ranks and among the commanders there talk that the billion spent each year field and equip special operations fighters not enough when our group was notified prepare for deployment there was huge spastic response procure items should already have had communications global positioning systems cold weather gear said one special forces major named chris interviewed afghanistan were taking off for afghanistan and the back the cargo plane were still practicing our new satellite phones stuff still arriving now and think hey this would have been great four weeks ago senior defense department official explained that rumsfeld and franks had made conscious decision move fast despite the risks there was clear decision made not wait for stately buildup forces the brink combat and only then walk through the wall said member rumsfeld inner circle the campaign exposed shortage aircraft refuel helicopters long missions gen bailey said said the air force would like the variant the marine corps osprey new aircraft that has been delayed serious technical problems but bailey like other pentagon leaders cautioned against thinking afghanistan the model for all future wars mind you have very careful about trying apply too specifically the lessons afghanistan said had very successful campaign with air power surrogate forces with special forces can duplicate things under our control like air power and special forces but where are those indigenous forces where does that exist other places the world
