with the sun setting behind his herd holsteins goedhart looks out over what ought tranquil scene the mountains ringing this quiet valley north las vegas seem remote and wild when the shoshone and paiute tribes passed through here thousand years ago but the mountain the middle the big flat one straight across the valley from his sprawling dairy farm makes goedhart blood boil and lot other nevadans too the next few weeks president bush expected sign order that would make the plateau called yucca mountain the world first nuclear waste depository does and nevada can convince congress reject the idea spent fuel from nuclear power plants and byproducts from nuclear bombs will arrive here from other states beginning after years and billion worth study energy secretary spencer abraham formally notified nevada jan would recommend yucca mountain over sites deaf smith county texas and hanford wash the nation nuclear waste dump for the next years consolidating all that radioactive waste one place will solve problems festering since the dawn the atomic age according the department energy getting most away from the nuclear reactors that supply percent the nation power would protect large metropolitan areas major waterways and the oceans the energy department claims would relieve overburdened storage areas near the reactors some which could otherwise forced shut down meet federal safety guidelines also might spur construction new nuclear plants part the bush administration plan diversify national energy supplies and could thwart any terrorist plan kill thousands americans blowing nuclear plant stealing radioactive fuel for dirty bombs but viewed from nevada creating single site for nuclear waste step down dangerous path this not solution all said goedhart one about residents rural amargosa valley near the foothills yucca mountain bigger problem opponents say they not convinced the mountain stability just years ago earthquake miles away measured the richter scale and surrounding the mountain are ancient volcanoes that while extinct still cause worry one the biggest threats release into the ground water said kaitlin backlund executive director nevada environmental group citizen alert you basically building man made trash can and sticking into the mountain the state nevada has filed numerous lawsuits block the dump oscar goodman mayor fast growing las vegas about miles away has promised arrest anyone who drives nuclear waste through his city not surprising that the nuclear dump shaping the ultimate not back yard fight but opponents claim that potential problems reach far beyond nevada borders trucks and trains transporting the waste yucca mountain would pass within mile estimated million people crosses the country would take about trips over the next quarter century move all the current waste nearly four times the number radioactive waste transports the government has made the history the nuclear age the same time plenty spent fuel would remain the nation nuclear plants since must sit cooling ponds for five years before can safely moved that makes many the arguments for single site moot opponents claim you not really consolidating anything says kaitlin backlund executive director nevada environmental group citizen alert yucca mountain just adding one more security risk for the country and then there are more perplexing problems such how warn future civilizations not disturb the site settle there who knows even what languages future residents the area will speak that what concerns amargosa valley resident doris jackson the most she says feisty year old who for two decades has owned the dusty stateline saloon amp gambling hall she has fought the yucca mountain project for years six months ago she finally put some her acres the valley for sale but hasn had any interest yet like others jackson suggests the government continue researching other options such finding ways break down the radioactivity waste reusing until disappears civilizations come and jackson says who think are just leave sitting there for future generations journey the center the argument nearly feet underground beneath yucca mountain scientist and engineer patrick rowe explains why thinks storing the waste here the best option rowe has worked yucca mountain since helping drill hundreds holes for water and geologic samples before that worked the neighboring nevada test site where the government conducted more than nuclear weapons experiments former west texas oil worker rowe also helped dig foot wide mile exploratory tunnel into yucca mountain five years ago since then energy department experts inside the tunnel and out have run tests everything from how rocks conduct heat how yucca mountain only inhabitants rats tortoises and few other species might affected the waste dump have years data and still collecting explained rowe all the science supports this site standing underground near the spot where acres spent nuclear fuel encased torpedo like metal casks would entombed hard imagine how anything buried this deep could ever threat the surface despite the huge tunnel the sun doesn penetrate this far cold about degrees january afternoon and noticeably drier than even the desert plains surrounding yucca mountain for miles rowe agrees with the environmentalists that water our biggest concern the only credible mechanism for transporting radionuclides but mere seven inches rain falls yucca mountain average year that almost undetectable amount millimeter seeps down this far the water table another feet below rowe said and even water carries radioactive waste away from the mountain said the local watershed stops far before any residential area waterway for earthquakes rowe said they are primarily surface phenomena this far underground said any movement the surface couldn even felt place with radioactive history yucca mountain physical attributes are just one factor making the energy department site choice except for las vegas there isn major metropolitan area within miles the mountain about the only people who live amargosa valley are retirees people who work the nearby silica mine smattering businesses such goedhart dairy jackson saloon few small pistachio farms nearly percent surrounding nye county fact owned the federal government nellis air force base borders one side yucca mountain and the square mile nevada test site borders another along with isolation the region has radioactive past like other the country conducted the vast majority its nuclear weapons tests the nevada test site beginning january nearly everybody the small towns near here has some connection the test site many tell stories about friends relatives with cancer radiation poisoning their nuclear past makes some locals ambivalent about the yucca mountain debate the possibility that the government may provide mitigation payments the waste site approved and the local jobs could create also helps soothe hard feelings personally don care either way said valley resident angela peterson already got the nevada test site and everything else what difference would make since the nuclear weapons testing moratorium the test site has been used training center for hazardous materials teams more recently has been used for counter terrorism training and the bush administration considering proposal make national anti terrorist training center that happens all the more reason why yucca mountain makes sense for nuclear waste dump the energy department and other proponents say the real question you want transport this stuff underground site surrounded federal security place where nobody can get asked energy department spokesman joe davis you want leave sitting the banks the oceans and rivers and some the country most populous cities the web yucca mountain www ymp gov bob keefe covers the west coast for cox newspapers contact him bkeefe coxnews com endit story filed cox
