the goal the research partnership between washington and the auto industry midsize car that would miles gallon with loss performance carrying capacity was stretch critics said when was established president clinton turned out they were right but successor program announced the energy department last week centering fuel cells instead hybrid diesel electric systems some ways even larger leap portrayed auto executives and fuel cell experts fuel cells which convert hydrogen into electric current cleanly quietly and very efficiently could appear the next few years cell phones and laptop computers and while after that lawn mowers scooters and perhaps vacuum cleaners but not cars least not soon cars the industry view are down the line said peter hoffman editor and publisher the hydrogen and fuel cell letter among the problems practical technology for storing hydrogen the quantities needed for vehicle has yet invented the carmakers hope for metal that can absorb hydrogen and later release when heated but for now they are working with tanks which hydrogen stored pressures pounds per square inch level seldom seen consumer products and the technology for attaching the hydrogen metal for storage were perfected the infrastructure for distributing and retailing liquid hydrogen does not exist that formidable challenge the people who tried sell much simpler alternative vehicle fuel fuel natural gas discovered their sorrow the 1990s natural gas cars require hardly any new technology and natural gas lines reach tens millions homes and businesses but extending them filling stations proved impractical and natural gas has cost advantage over gasoline perhaps the biggest problem for fuel cells that for now least they cost roughly times more for the same amount power than internal combustion engines hoffman the author tomorrow energy hydrogen fuel cells and the prospects for cleaner planet mit press said that since mobile fuel cells are not now commercially available their price not clear but that estimates range from and per kilowatt capacity car needs about kilowatts which implies propulsion system costing the cost could come down somewhat the body were made something besides ordinary steel and aluminum cars today are but that too requires new inventions general motors which eager produce fuel cells executives say that they may not have make fuel cells cheap plain old gasoline engines since fuel cell car would earn its keep higher fuel economy and would not need expensive components like catalytic converter transmission electric motors not require them but they would still have cut costs least percent they say ford and daimlerchrysler conjunction with ballard power systems inc fuel cell manufacturer vancouver british columbia have built prototypes and invested heavily bringing costs down ballard says has supplied fuel cells honda hyundai nissan and volkswagen well researchers have made great progress making the cells small enough for automotive use but they still have long way costs manhattan scientifics inc fuel cell company that preparing several products for commercialization said believes customers will fact pay per kilowatt but only for cells that generate only about watt and thus cost about that would enough for cell phones laptop computers not cars the company chief operating officer jack harrod said also hoped sell units for lawnmowers and scooters but not until the price was below kilowatt thought might need get down but ordinary gasoline engines cars produce the equivalent kilowatt for industry experts say fuel cells for homes may easier choice experts say since even middle sized suburban home with central air conditioning uses only kilowatts peak making the cost disadvantage per kilowatt less problem there also storage problem the house has natural gas from which hydrogen can easily extracted and house uses energy hours day which would maximize the benefits efficiency and low pollution most cars contrast are the road only two hours day for car executives justify the cost fuel cells whatever that turns out they are considering branching into entirely new areas christopher borroni bird director design and technology fusion general motors suggested using fuel cell equipped cars generate electric current when they are parked and plugging them deliver power the electricity grid car manufacturers are optimistic that they can eventually drive the price way down although unlike the old partnership the new one has timetable even specific goals according jennie sweet the council for automotive research the private sector side the partnership and also not complete break with the old program the old partnership included fuel cell research and the new one will continue research diesel electric hybrids another problem for the new partnership the all nothing nature fuel cell vehicle while the old partnership never produced the mile per gallon sedan did advance some technologies that now have toe hold the market and are infiltrating deeper into assembly plants and showrooms the old partnership goaded toyota and honda which were not members into putting hybrid electric gasoline models the road and american manufacturers and daimler chrysler are various stages developing their own hybrid models for sale
