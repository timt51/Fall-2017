although talking wireless phone the size your palm may seem the image cutting edge technology cell phone really nothing more than radio and like the stereo your car cell phone can suffer from the same limitations blocked signals and interference when you behind mountain down the second level parking garage wireless signal will fade just like radio station your car said reynolds president for network operations cingular the cell phone traces its roots back the 1920s when patrol cars large cities used radio telephones keep touch with one another the bulky devices depended one central tower and had limited number channels only few conversations could occur the same time breakthrough came the late 1940s when amp engineers decided stretch the limited number available radio frequencies dividing city into sectors cells each with its own low power transmitter that would allow calls handed off car traveled around city because the system operated such low power channel carrying conversation one cell could reused nearby cells without interference when more capacity was needed cell site could divided again but was the portable cell phone first developed the early 1970s that fueled the growth the industry today the number cell sites the united states one the most visible signs that growth there are more than sites nearly six times the number that existed cell phone use grew the late 1980s carriers started look for new ways boost capacity and offer new services like text messaging and voice mail then cell phones had operated analog networks which essentially split the radio spectrum into many channels but the carriers believed that analog technology was inefficient use the limited spectrum allocated them the government because reserved channel for the duration each call the introduction digital technology the early 1990s allowed carriers boost capacity squeezing more out the available radio spectrum two competing digital systems emerged one time division multiple access tdma allows multiple users gain access common channel without interference allocating unique time slots each caller round robin fashion the other code division multiple access cdma tags each conversation with code and instructs the cell phone extract that code from the others being broadcast the air the differences between the two systems can compared modes conversation crowded room with tdma everyone takes turns talking sequence with cdma everyone speaking different language the same time and you listen for the one person speaking your language debates continue over which system more efficient early cdma promised carry digital conversations for every analog conversation but technical obstacles have reduced that ratio something like today comparison tdma carries about seven calls for every analog conversation rather than adopt tdma cdma national digital standard however the federal government allowed manufacturers and carriers choose between the systems that the main reason that phone bought from amp for example won work the sprint pcs network amp and cingular use tdma and sprint pcs and verizon use cdma the adoption one standard europe gsm advanced version the digital technology available the united states has helped spur the relatively smooth expansion the cell phone industry there said roberta wiggins director wireless mobile services the yankee group consulting firm gsm has been adopted few wireless companies the united states notably voicestream and amp and cingular are planning such shift well europe had the advantage because they basically had one standard wiggins said result they further along technology and coverage even with the growth digital networks some parts the united states mainly remote rural areas are served only analog systems the federal communications commission requires carriers continue support analog networks although some cities only few channels are available user has analog phone more than percent phones use today are dual mode meaning they will work either digital analog system many wireless industry analysts expect the fcc drop its mandate that carriers support analog networks within the next five years leading carriers convert any remaining analog systems digital
