How do you compile and run your code? Provide instructions for Athena Linux.
TO COMPILE
Starting from the root directory of the solution folder, run the following:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

TO RUN
Starting from the root directory of the solution folder, run the following:
./build/a1 ./swp/<name_of_swp>.swp
where <name_of_swp> should be replaced with the actual name of the swp file
that you want the program to read. 

The artifact files are located at ./sample_one.png and ./sample_two.png
The swp file that generates sample_one.png is sample_one.swp
The swp file that generates sample_two.png is sample_two.swp
In order to for the program to render sample_one or sample_two,
the user will have to run the program with the appropriate swp
and use the mouse to rotate the figure into the correct perspective.

Did you collaborate with anyone in the class? If so, let us know who you talked to and what sort of
help you gave or received.
No.

Were there any references (books, papers, websites, etc.) that you found particularly helpful for
completing your assignment? Please provide a list.
N/A

Are there any known problems with your code? If so, please provide a list and, if possible, describe
what you think the cause is and how you might fix them if you had more time or motivation. This
is very important, as we’re much more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what’s
going on.
No.

Did you do any of the extra credit? If so, let us know how to use the additional features. If there was
a substantial amount of work involved, describe how you did it.
No.

Do you have any comments about this assignment that you’d like to share? We know this was a tough
one, but did you learn a lot from it? Or was it overwhelming?
No comments.
